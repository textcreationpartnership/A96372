            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the ſpecial, and I doubt not, by the good hand of Providence it was, and is, that God hath appointed me to bee a Co-labourer in this part of his Vineyard, with your reverend Pastor, who it is that bears the burthen and heat of the day; and I bleſs God for that encouragement that I have received from you, in respect of your love, and great appearance, whereby God hath put a great opportunity into my hand of doing good, and I hope my labours have not been in vain in the Lord; I do account you my Crown, and my joy, and I have with much comfort and rejoycing preached amongſt you; and when I have had occaſion ſometimes for one Lords Day (though but for one Lords day) to bee abſent, I have returned with as much ſatisfaction to my ſelf, unto the Congregation,
<pb facs="tcp:170460:4"/>as I have done to ſee my deareſt friends, when I have been a long time from them. Of thoſe ſeveral ſubjects upon which I have preached amongſt you, I have judged this that I have now publiſhed, moſt to edification, being plain and practical; for you can, and mine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth bear mee witneſs, that I have not uſed the enticing words of mens wiſdome, but have endeavoured, in ſome meaſure, to Preach in the power and demonſtration of the Spirit, which I account not only fitteſt for thoſe which are, as they call them, of the more ignorant ſort, but even for thoſe which are learnedeſt, wiſeſt, and of greateſt underſtanding; for wee are commanded to Preach as the Oracles of God, and Oracles uſe to bee plain, as to their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, though (it may be) profound, as to their ſenſe; and I account it the hardeſt task of learning, to make the Myſteries of God plain, and that wood to bee fitteſt for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is leaſt knotty; therefore I deſire you would not bee offended, but edified by the plain ſtile and matter of this Treatiſe: If by reading of it you bee brought to that which is the title and ſum of it, <hi>viz. The Power of Godlineſs,</hi> it ſufficeth; when one chooſeth a Sword, not for ornament, but for uſe; one looks not ſo much to the Scabbard, or other
<pb facs="tcp:170460:2"/>curioſities of it, as to the mettle; and therefore wee rather chooſe one, whoſe blade is made of ſteel, than of gold: The two-edged Sword of Gods Word, if it pierceth, and divideth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the joynts and the marrow, it doth the work for which wee uſe it, though it be not ſent forth, and made glittering by humane elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: though I deſire in this particular alſo to avoid miſtakes, for though I decry a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, yet I commend, and I deſire to uſe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent dreſs for Truth to walk abroad in. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is ſaid of a young Painter, who was to draw the picture of a fair woman; <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chram non potuit, pinxit divitem,</hi> he could not paint her fair, but painted her rich, ſo that her picture was rather gaudy, than comely and beautiful; and therefore, though I deſired you would pardon the plainneſs of this Treatiſe and my preaching among you, yet now I do recall that requeſt, accounting it unpardonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a crime; but I can adviſe you ſo, that you may commend the Treatiſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no other commendation do I deſire of it, <hi>viz.</hi> practiſe it, and I dare conſidently ſay you will commend it, or rather, that you will bleſs God for the truths and directions that are ſet down in it: Live thoſe holy books that you read, and you will like them, and doubtleſs it
<pb facs="tcp:170460:3"/>is impoſſible to like holineſs, without practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it; for when by reproofs, or practical directions, the conſcience is awakened, it will bee clamorous, if not obeyed; for if it ſleeps not, it will not bee ſilent, it will bee tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us our duty, which if not performed, our guilt: it is <hi>index, judex, vindex,</hi> it ſheweth us what wee ſhould do, which if wee do not, it condemns us, and becomes not only our Judge, but our Executioner, for this is that worm that dieth not, but if wee hearken to the whiſpers and teachings of conſcience, guided by the Word of God, it will prove the beſt friend wee have, next to Chriſt; beſides your practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what you have heard, and may read in this Treatiſe. I have one thing more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of you, which is your continual fervent prayers for a bleſſing upon mee, and my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours amongſt you. And it is not eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether thoſe your prayers will bring greater advantage to your ſelves, or mee; for if by your ſupplications God ſhall enlarge his gifts and graces in mee, I ſhall endeavour to lay them out to your edification, which alſo I deſire you would beg of the Lord for mee, who am</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170460:5"/>ſpirit which the Angels have, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. it is not a glance of the eye, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, that is, looking upon with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this is continual, they never have their eye off, they alwayes behold, though their imployments are, as to the object va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, for they are Miniſtring Spirits, ſometimes imployed about the preſerving, or delivering the people of God from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral dangers.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſeriouſly conſider, whether we have not as great cauſe to admire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, love, and praiſe God, as they; it is true, they are in poſſeſſion of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which we have not as yet in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but are as ſure of, as if wee had; wee have the Word, the Covenant, the Oath of God for it, in which it is impoſſible for him to fail; if we have not ſtrong conſolation, it is not his fault, but ours, that wee do not believe him; nor ſhould our not having poſſeſſion be thought any ſufficient cauſe of the leaſt abatement of our love, or thanks: To that purpoſe this ſimile hath much ſatisfied me, <hi>viz.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were twenty poor men, to whom ſome very rich man had promiſed, and upon his promiſe was actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170460:5"/>one hundred pound apiece, the tenth, or laſt of thoſe poor men, would have as much joy, and love, and high, and grateful thoughts of the rich mans libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, (except) hee doubted ſomewhat his performance, as the firſt man that had the preſent poſſeſſion. God is beſtowing on his Saints, as faſt as may be, the Crown of Glory, it is but a few hours, nay, but as a moment, compared to Eternity, before the Crown of Glory ſhall be ſet upon thy head. Is it not enough that thy fears and doubts rob God of the glory that thou oweſt to his truth, but they muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a ſufficient reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt with-hold and deny the praiſe and love that are due to his goodneſs? nay, let me freely and truly ſay, that wee have much more to praiſe God for, and admire him, than the Angels; <hi>For to which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, I will pardon thy ſins, and blot out thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as a thick Cloud; though thy ſins be as red as ſcarlet, I will make them as white as ſnow.</hi> And ſurely he never forgave them one ſin, he hath forgiven us thouſands; and that which exceedingly adds to his goodneſs, is to conſider how dear it coſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170460:6"/>him to pardon us: Suppoſe a ſervant ſhould riſe up againſt his Lord, and the ſword with whom he intended to ſlay him, ſhould be beat back again upon his own head, but his Lord taking compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon him, ſhould not only receive him into favour again, but be at the charge of his cure, though he knew it would come to more than his wages or ſervice would amount to, though he ſhould live a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; ſurely our infidelity muſt be exceeding great, that ſhould make us abate God ſo much of his praiſes, becauſe we have no actual poſſeſſion, though there be but a few houres betwixt heaven and us, as the praiſe that is due to him, for his pardoning mercy comes to.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. THe next thing wherein the Power of Godlineſs conſiſts, is in our high prizings of Chriſt; very frequently the people of God have at their firſt converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proportionably higher thoughts of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170460:6"/>Sanctification, then of Juſtification, then afterwards they have, but as they grow in grace, ſo they grow in their eſteem of Chriſt, not as if at their firſt converſion, they had higher thoughts of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then of Juſtification, nor as if the more holy they grew, the leſs beauty they ſaw in holineſs, but much more poſitively, but not comparatively; if at their firſt Converſion, their eſteem of Juſtification to Sanctification, were as one hundred to ten, afterwards it is as many thouſands to an hundred; if they look upon Holineſs alone, it is very beautiful, but if the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt ſtands by it, it is but as a foyle; if we ſhould hear of the holieſt man that ever liv'd upon the earth, with what joy ſhould wee go to ſee him, to confer and have communion with him, to hear <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> pray, to hear <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> Preach, to ſee the meek and patient carriage of <hi>Job;</hi> theſe were rare things. But further, ſuppoſe God ſhould ſend an Angel from heaven to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, how ſingular would his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be of God? with what feeling and reliſh would he ſpeak of the things of heaven? but Chriſt was far beyond theſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170460:7"/>for he was God. We never have, nor can in this world be ſenſible enough, or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prize, or know the wiſdome and holineſs of the ſpeeches and actions of our bleſſed Saviour: If Chriſt were upon earth, what would we give to be one day with him, one hour ſpent in his preſence and communion with him, we would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count worth ten thouſand worlds? but Chriſtians have too high an eſteem of the corporal preſence of Chriſt, and think, that becauſe Chriſt in that reſpect is abſent from them, that they have not as neer and full a way, as if he were on earth, then we could not diſcern his excellencies, but by the eye of Faith, and ſo we may now.</p>
                  <p>Never did Chriſt give ſo clear and full communications, and diſcoveries of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Apoſtles while he was on earth, as after his Aſcenſion, oh the infinite &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible excellencies and glory of Chriſt; that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. is exceedingly worthy our ſerious conſideration; the Apoſtle did account not one, but all worldly things, even his legal righteouſneſs as loſs, &amp;c. yet many things we have a high eſteem of, before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it, as generally it is in all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170460:7"/>worldly things; we over-value them at a diſtance, but finde them to be but vanity, when we poſſeſs them, and have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them; but the Apoſtle tells us, that his high prizings of the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, was not meerly ſpeculative and notional, but experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and that his eſteem of it did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but encreaſe upon his experience; for, ſaith he, I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and am ſtill of the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay, have higher thoughts of Chriſt than before; for when he look'd upon the excellencies of Chriſt onely with the eye of Faith, he counted all things loſs, but when experience is added to his Faith, he counts them dung.</p>
                  <p>Since I ſee Chriſt is the ſcope of the whole Scripture, that the very Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to look into Goſpel myſteries, and that the great work of the Spirit is to raiſe us to have high thoughts of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.14. And conſidering many other things which I have made mention of elſwhere, and having had ſome ſmall experience of that peace and joy, in believing, which hath followed upon the drawing forth of mine affections to Chriſt: I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170460:8"/>and ſet my ſelf to conſider, how one may be convinced of the excellency of Chriſt, and I finde that there is a great deal of difference betwixt a rational and ſpeculative, and an experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of this matter, and thoſe cloſings with Chriſt, which are from love and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and thoſe that are from conviction only, are far different; and indeed one difference is this, that thoſe ſweetneſſes &amp; reliſhes, that joy and delight which one findes in ones experimental knowledge of Chriſt cannot be utter'd, nor can one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them ſo, as to make another that hath them not to underſtand them; but for rational and ſpeculative convictions, one may communicate them, and the grounds of them; and if they do ſeriouſly conſider of thoſe grounds, upon which we were convinced, they may finde a native energy to convince them, not as if any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments or grounds have ſuch an efficacy as to convince in matters of this nature, except the Spirit of God do give ſtrength and efficacy to, and open the heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. I finde that this is one diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Goſpel truths, and natural truths, <hi>viz.</hi> that in natural truths, if I am
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170460:8"/>fully convinc'd of the premiſes from which the concluſion doth naturally flow, we cannot but cloſe with the concluſion; but in Goſpel truths, though the Spirit of God doth evidence the truth of the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet there needs an aſſiſting and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening act of the Spirit to be enabled to give our conſent to the concluſion; for as in natural actions, as in moving ones hand, walking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if we have the will, we have the deed alſo; but as for Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, it is God that gives both the will and the deed, of his good pleaſure, not the will of his good pleaſure, and the deed of our good pleaſure, or the deed of common providence, and the will of free-grace, but both of free-grace, or which is all one, of his good pleaſure; and as God keeps both our will and deed in his own hand, and diſpenſeth them ſeverally; ſo that when he hath given us the will, he keeps the deed ſtill in his hand, that we may know that we have not a power to do good even when wee have a will; <hi>ſo that the good which wee would, wee do not, and the evill which wee would not, that wee do,</hi> that free-grace may have all the glory, ſo as to our faith; the Spirit of God gives
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170460:9"/>light and ſatisfaction, as to the premiſes, and yet keeps our aſſent to the concluſion in his own hand, as it's evident in divers that are in deſertion, though they confeſs, whoſoever love the brethren, are paſt from death to life, and that they do love the brethren, yet cannot yeeld to the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are paſt from death to life: For as God did by his power cauſe his fire to burn their cords, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. and yet not to ſinge a hair of their head, or as he made light in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and darkneſs in <hi>Egypt:</hi> So many times God gives light to premiſes, and ſuffers his children, as in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> darkneſs, to the concluſion, and yet abundantly ſatisfied, as to the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but to return; becauſe convictions may be communicated as to the grounds of them, and thoſe grounds upon which one is convinc'd, another may be convinc'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; therefore I ſhall ſet down one of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons, which may convince one of the excellency of Chriſt, as for experiences in many caſes it is not lawful, and in none poſſibly fully to be expreſt; therefore thus; That Chriſt was God and Man, I take it for granted; for if the devil ſhould ſay it were ſo, and I know him to be the Father
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170460:9"/>of Lyes, yet I hope I ſhould not doubt it; and though the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay it's not ſo, yet I lay this as a foundation, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to experience, finding thoſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous joyes that grow from the high prize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, and thus build upon it; I ſee, and clearly perceive, what ſingular beauty, comelineſs, and activity, and rare operations, the Soul, that is but a creature, gives unto the body; ſo that the eye ſees, and hand works, and feet walk, the hand and tongue make rare muſick, and body lives and moves, and continues in health and ſtrength, fourty, eighty yeares; and when I ſee the ſelf-ſame body dead, and obſerve what gaſtly look, inſtead of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that it neither moves hand nor foot, and how quickly it putrifies and rots when the Soul is gone. I conclude all theſe excellencies that the body had when living, were communicated to it from the Soul: For as if I ſhould hear ſome rare mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and yet when I came into the room, ſhould ſee a Lute lye on the Table, but not ſee any one in the room, I ſhould conclude, that this Lute did not make the muſick of it ſelf without a hand to move it, and that the Lute did not give skill to him that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170460:10"/>plaid; for let one that hath no skill, have never ſo well a tuned inſtrument, he can make no muſick; therefore if the Soul, that is but a poor creature, can inable the body to do what of it ſelf it is ſo unable to do, and this by its union with the body, what muſt we think? what rare excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies muſt neceſſarily be imparted to the Humane Nature of Chriſt, by that union which the Deity hath with it, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as much as a living body, as to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and operations doth exceed a dead; ſo, and much more did Chriſt, as man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all men, being united to the God-Head, eſpecially the union of the Deity with the Humane Nature of Chriſt, being neerer than that of the Soul with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. I leave theſe things to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſpirituall underſtanding Chriſtian; but this I ſhall adde, that one never ſhall be ſatisfied fully, unleſs to that conviction which wee have from argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; wee have that alſo which is to bee had from experience.</p>

THe third thing, wherein the Power of godlineſs conſiſts, is living contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to providences, I mean, not only above, but contrary to the temptations which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Providences: So wee read in <hi>Job,</hi> when God had taken away from him all that he had, the temptation that was natural, conſidering our corruptions, which Satan pretended, and he doubted not but would certainly follow, upon this Providence, was, that <hi>Job</hi> would curſe God, but <hi>Job</hi> did not only not curſe God, but he bleſſed him, which was quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Satans expectation, and to the temptation that was incident to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: if <hi>Job</hi> had been only patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his affliction, it had been different, but not contrary to that carriage, which in ſuch a Providence, one is generally tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, bleſſing and curſing, are the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, not to murmure or repine, if one goeth no further, is not to curſe, nor yet to bleſs, but of a middle nature; and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170460:11"/>aimes ſhould bee higher, than onely not to repine and murmure when God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, or not to revenge whenmen injure or perſecute us; it is not enough not to curſe, but wee muſt bleſs them that curſe us; it is not enough not to diſpair in the time of perſecution, but we muſt rejoyce in tribulation, and bee exceeding glad, when wee ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake: The Apoſtle bids us to add to our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence godlineſs, if that with which our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is exerciſed be afflictions, if injuries from men, brotherly kindneſs. It was a rare carriage of a good woman, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up her childe dead, whom ſhe had laid down well, inſtead of murmuring, fell a bleſſing and admiring the goodneſs of God, that all her children were not ſo; this was quite contrary to the carriage of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men in ſuch a Providence; that was alſo a ſingular carriage of one, who having had extraordinary joyes in her ſickneſs, finding that ſhe was a recovering, fell a trembling exceedingly; and being ask'd whether her joyes were gone, ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not ſo much as abated, but that ſhe trembled to think that ſhe ſhould live to diſhonour her God that gave them.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="4">4. THe fourth thing, wherein the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs conſiſts, is in this, that we mortifie temptations, if I may ſo call it, when few things are temptations, not that a growne Chriſtian has fewer temptations, yet fewer things are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to him; 'tis one thing to conquer a temptation; ſo as to put it to flight, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing to diſarm it, and deſtroy it, ſo that it ſhall not be able to fight againſt us any more; as for example, the ſight of a beautiful woman tempts one to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but through the grace of God one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts and conquers that temptation; but this is far better, that the ſight of ſuch a beauty ſhould not ſo much as tempt one: it is better not to have ones houſe on fire, than quench it, a Philoſopher ſeeing a great man, having great attendants, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the things of this world, ſaid, See how many things I have no need of; ſo a grown Chriſtian may ſay, ſee how many things are no temptations to me, as thou
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170460:12"/>grow'ſt this way, ſo thou grow'ſt in grace; thoſe words that formerly would have ſo provoked thee, that thou hadſt much ado to prevail with thine heart not to revenge the injury; now ſuch words are like a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let ſhot againſt a rock, which neither bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor ſhakes it; conſider how many temptations thou haſt this way mortified; when the devil ſhew'd our Saviour the Kingdomes of the world, and all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof, that ſight did not ſo much as tempt our Saviour: for we muſt not think that Chriſt did wraſtle with temptations as wee do; the holieſt man, when theſe ſparks from hell fall upon him, they do take more or leſs hold upon him, though it is not alwayes with him, as in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary violent temptation, when he cannot quench that fire without as much clamour, toyle, and trouble, as a houſe that is on fire is quench'd. Indeed very often the people of God do quench temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as eaſily, as one may put out a ſpark newly fallen upon Tinder, one may put it out eaſier than with a wet finger; but no temptation took any hold on Chriſt at all, it did not at all kindle upon him, though he was caſt-into a Fiery Furnace
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170460:12"/>of temptations, heated by the wrath of God, and the malice of the powers of darkneſs, ſeven-fold hotter than ever yet any Saint was, not ſo much as the ſmell paſt upon our Saviour, nor a hair of his head was ſinged; it is a rare thing to have the world crucified to us, and we unto the world; a dead man is not tempted with the greateſt Beauty in the world, though ſhe ſhould ſtand before him, nor a living man with the faireſt woman in the world, that ſhould lye dead before him, ſhe would rather fright, than allure him; it is a rare temper, when generally temptations are as blaſphemous thoughts are to Gods people, which aſtoniſh and terrifie, but intice them not to conſent, the world had baſe thoughts of <hi>Paul,</hi> and he was not behinde hand with that, for he had as baſe thoughts of the world, for he was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world, and the world was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to him, wee ſhould uſe the world, as the world uſeth us, that deſpiſeth us, we ſhould deſpiſe it; that wicked men can ſtand unſhaken by all the terrours that are thundered againſt them out of the Law, and unmoved by all the ſweet promiſes and offers of the Goſpel; ſo let the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170460:13"/>and allurements of the world be to us, now temptations are mortified, and ceaſe to be temptations. 1. When wee are clearly convinced of the poſitive vanity of all thoſe pleaſures, and that ſin tempts us withall, this will make us not ſo much as parley with ſin, as wee do not ſo much as cheapen fruit that is wholly rotten, and worth nothing. 2. To be convinced of, and affected with the ſuper-excellency of thoſe things that God hath promiſed in the Goſpel for them that love him; for it may bee wee ſhall finde it a hard matter to ſee the creature to be nothing, but it will be eaſie to ſee God to be more; by our underſtanding the greatneſſe of the price that wee muſt pay for the pleaſure of ſin, it will quickly break off the bargain; for wee do with as much indignation leave him that asks us a hundred times more than the thing is worth, as wee do him that asks us a ſmall price for that which is worth nothing. 3. Another way to keep off moſt temptations from taking hold of us, is, by being convinc'd that wee have no need of that which ſin offers us, for generally they are not neceſſaries, but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities that tempt us. 4. We muſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170460:13"/>endeavour to encreaſe our love to God, for then, though it were poſſible, that ſin ſhould offer us ſomething proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that which God promiſeth, yet love would turn the ſcale. 5. Alwayes to be ſpiritually or lawfully imploy'd, <hi>non va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,</hi> gives generally a ſpeedier and fuller denial to temptation, than <hi>non licet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there are ſome caſes wherein temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may become no temptations to us, and yet it may not proceed from ſtrength of grace, nor from mortifyed corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Firſt, when tentations are ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by a contrary Maſter Sin, that they have no power at all over us: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if Covetouſneſs be our Maſter Sin, and has got full dominion over one, all tentations that are coſtly take no hold of us, ſuch a man will not be at the charge of drunkenneſs, of gluttony, of vanity in apparrel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is but caſting out one devill with another, as it was with the Tribes of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> though they were enemies one to another, yet both were more enemies to <hi>Judah;</hi> ſo that thoſe of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerve under the Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> than not fight againſt <hi>Judah:</hi> So Vices,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170460:14"/>though they be contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet will not by their civil wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, weaken that oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they all make againſt Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The things that did formerly tempt us, may ceaſe to be temptations, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our luſts are mortified, but ſatisfied; as when a glutton or a drunkard hath ſo intemperately eaten and drunken, that his ſtomack is over-charged, ſo that he loath the Honey-comb, and the Wine that gives its colour in the cup tempts him not at that time, but it is, becauſe he hath wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf in his iniquities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When ſickneſs or age has made us unable to act thoſe ſins that formerly wee have committed: What if a drunkard in a violent Fever, or an old man weakened by age and ſin, is not tempted with wine, or beauty, it is not becauſe his luſts, but rather his body is mortified, and hee hath not left ſin, but ſin him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When by reaſon of ignorance and infancy wee are not yet capable of being tempted with ſome temptations, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with covetouſneſs, and luſt, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition: it had been little praiſe to <hi>Moſes</hi> to have deſpiſed the Treaſures and Honors
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170460:14"/>of <hi>Egypt</hi> in his infancy; therefore the Scripture, to ſhew the power of Grace in him, ſayes, that when he was of full age, he was ſo; but certainly in infants cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is not mortified, but bound up in the heart of a childe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.15.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. THe fifth thing, whereby the Power of Godlineſs may be diſcovered, is, by the manner of conquering temptations; as the power of godlineſs encreaſeth, ſo the conqueſt of temptation is: 1. More eaſie, when wee ſtand wraſtling and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with temptations, and the diſpute is ſo hot for a long while, that none doth know which way the victory inclines, it ſhewes grace to be weak; but when wee are ſpirituall <hi>Sampſons,</hi> then wee break theſe cords with which Satan endeavours to binde us, as a thred of tow ſcorch'd with the fire. 2. By the fulneſs of our conqueſt over temptations, if the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170460:15"/>preſently rallies its forces, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults us again, it often ſhewes the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was but weak. 3. When wee can overcome a temptation with feweſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives when wee are fain to think of the glory of heaven, the love and ſufferings of Chriſt, and many other like motives to overcome ſome trivial temptation, it ſhewes our grace to be but weak; but when the leaſt ſpiritual truth, or temporal mercy, is like <hi>Eleazer</hi> the Son of <hi>Dodo,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſcatter an whole Army of theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> he is one of Chriſts Worthies, the more ſtrength the motive hath upon which wee reſiſt, ſo it bee not carnall, the ſtronger our grace. 4. The more ſpirituall the motives are by which wee overcome, the more ſpirituall are we, the more pure the motives, the purer our grace, and the purer the ſtronger; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are purer motives then Judgements, Heaven than Hell, love than mercies, mercies already received, than the hope of future mercies, commands than rewards.</p>
                  <p>The fifth thing, in reſpect of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our overcoming temptations, wherein the power of godlineſs appears, is, when wee quickly and ſpeedily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170460:15"/>them: To conſult whether wee ſhould do that or no to which wee are tempted, argues either, that our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding is dark, or our love to God is cold.</p>
                  <p>There are but two things that are to bee conſulted of when wee are tempted, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it be a ſin or no that wee are tempted to? Wee knowing it to bee a ſin, whether wee ſhould commit it? The firſt argues: 1. Imperfection, in reſpect of our underſtanding in ſpiritual things, wee ſhould bee filled with the knowledge of the Will of God in all Spiritual Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and underſtanding: So that wee ſhould in all caſes bee preſently able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is pleaſing in his ſight. The ſecond argues, the abundant want of Grace; for when once wee know what is the Will of God, it is certainly a ſin not to do it: So the Apoſtle, <hi>Hee that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin.</hi> So that to conſult, and to deliberate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one ſhould ſerve God, is ſin; for as long as hee is conſulting, he doth it not. Indeed wee may conſult how wee may do the Will of God, with moſt advantage for his Glory, but not whether wee ſhould
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170460:16"/>do it or no: Wee ſhould utterly diſlike ſuch a Phyſitian, that ſhould conſult whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould cure us: It is <hi>Gibbeufs</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. There are two things that are not fit to deliberate of, God and Sin; for <hi>deliberatio non eſt niſi de mediis;</hi> Wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate only of the means, not of the end: Now God being the end of all things, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and ſin below the nature of means: Satans firſt great policy, when he tempted Chriſt, was to tempt him with ſuch a temptation, that might not ſeem to be a temptation; ſo hee did in his firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond temptation, but when hee ſaw that Chriſt was of ſuch wonderfull Wiſdome, and ſo ſharp-ſighted in the things of God, that he could not ſpin a temptation of ſo fine a thread, but hee could diſcern it. In the laſt temptation hee tries what hee could do with the ſtrength of motives, to perſwade him to do that, which hee could not but know to bee a ſin, ſince hee could do nothing by his ſubtill contrivances to deceive him, ſo that he ſhould take that for no ſin, which was one. But our Saviour breaks this Spiders Web, as well as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it; they are not ſo fine, but hee diſcernes them, nor ſo ſtrong, but hee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170460:16"/>breaks them; neither does Chriſt uſe any conſideration to diſcover that hee was tempted to a ſin, nor any conſultation, whether hee ſhould do it, when hee knew it to bee ſo, but preſently anſwers: For to conſider what advantages wee may have, by doing any thing which wee know to be a ſin, is a ſnare; therefore our Saviour anſwers to the Temptation, not to the Motive, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. But of this more largely in my Obſervations upon <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>It is a queſtion worth the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which is the holieſt act, exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to love a thing, and yet for Gods love to leave it; or to have our heart mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the love of a thing, and yet to leave it: To leave a thing wee love not, ſeems not to be thank-worthy, and to love the things of the world is a ſin, to love va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities is a ſin, though to leave them for his ſake is not. It was a greater act of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in our Saviour, not to be affected with the glory of the World, than to be affected with it, and yet to refuſe it upon ſuch termes as it was offered; therefore to decide this queſtion, wee muſt underſtand there are three kindes of things; ſome
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170460:17"/>that wee may neither love nor have, as ſin; others, that wee may have, but not love, as riches. Other things we may have and love, as Wife and Children; to love thoſe things which wee ought not to love, and yet to leave them for Gods ſake, is but half our duty, for, for Gods ſake wee ought as well not to love them, as to leave them, ſince he commands us not at all to love them: It is not enough not to have a comparative love, but wee muſt not have ſo much as a poſitive love to them, but for our Wife and Children, &amp;c. whom wee ought to love; there wee are, then only not to love them, when they come in competition with God, wee may leave a poſitive love to many things, but compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to none in ſuch a caſe; in ſuch a caſe he that hates not Father and Mother, and Houſe and Land, and life it ſelf, for my Names ſake, is not worthy of me.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="6">6. THe next thing, wherein the Power of Godlineſs conſiſts, are Inward Mortifications, for as for outward morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, they are either concomitants or preparatories to, rather than things wherein Holineſs conſiſts, and the caſes wherein Outward Mortification are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and acceptable to God are:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When providences caſt us upon them, as when God takes away our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, ſo that we have neither food nor rayment, nor where to lay our head, to ſuffer theſe patiently, thankfully, and fruitfully, is more acceptable with God, then to give all one has to the poor; and whether the patient thankful poor Saint, that is relieved, or he that relieves him, offers the moſt acceptable Sacrifice; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer out of obedience, and love to God, or to give almes, be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him, judge you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When wee fall into them by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, then the outward mortifications
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170460:18"/>that we ſuffer, wee ſhould rejoyce in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the duties of Holineſs cannot be performed without them, as in cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when one muſt either loſe ſome early publike Ordinance, or endure the Winters cold, by riſing betimes to enjoy it, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other time of the day to neglect any private or publike duty, by reaſon of the coldneſs of the Weather, if it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to our health, is ſuch Epicuriſme, that is unworthy of a Chriſtian; ſo then, if outward mortifications be neceſſary Concomitants, or ſingular Preparatories to duties, or if by omiſſion of them, wee ſhall give juſt ſcandal to weak brethren, in ſuch caſe they become duties; but doubtleſs the Power of Godlineſs conſiſts not in them; many that have been much exerciſed in them, have had little Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells the ſtory of one <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius,</hi> who was called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <hi>Gubba,</hi> becauſe he eat nothing but barley, pulſe, and ſtood in a ditch all his time; for <hi>Gubba</hi> in the <hi>Syriack,</hi> ſignifieth a ditch. You ſhall ſee the groſs ignorance of this man for <hi>Flavianus</hi> ſending for him, and ordaining him Miniſter, the next Lords Day, being ſent for to Church, ſaid, He
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170460:18"/>durſt not come, for fear he ſhould be made Miniſter again: Doubtleſs inward mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications have great advantages above outward mortifications.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Invvard mortifications are alvvayes lawful, and neceſſary, outvvard are not ſo, as vvhen they are prejudiciall to ones health.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Outvvard mortifications are very ſubject to degenerate into ſuperſtition, as evidently among the Papiſts, that vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they moſt boaſt of, are things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the ſingle lives of their Prieſts, who although they have no Wives, yet are prodigious in their luſts, and though they boaſt ſo much of their auſterities, yet the <hi>Gymnoſophys</hi> amongſt the Heathen, and ſome <hi>Hermits</hi> amongſt the Turks, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, if not exceed them in auſterities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When voluntarily, and out of choice taken upon us, they do rather puff up, than edifie, for outvvard mortifications are very glorious in the ſight of the world; and it may bee that may be one reaſon, vvhy our bleſſed Saviour did not much uſe them, becauſe he vvould deceive hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome, for even carnal perſons do honour outvvard mortifications, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170460:19"/>mortifications are inviſible, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to hide themſelves even from Gods people.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wee are to begin at inward mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; and this was our Saviours me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, hee would not put his Diſciples at firſt upon faſting, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. as <hi>John</hi> did, for <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples were Saints, before they were his Diſciples; but our Saviour choſe ſuch for his Diſciples, as were old cloth, and old bottles, and indeed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mortifications without inward, are like the ſpreading of a cold wet cloth upon the face of one who hath the Small Pox coming out, it may make, by driving in the corrupt humours, the face more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, but it ſends the poyſon to the heart; therefore endeavour after inward mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, for it is far better to mortifie our love, and deſire of riches, then to caſt them away, better to have them, and not love them, than not to have them.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. THe ſeventh thing, wherein the Power of Godlineſs conſiſts, is, in having dominion over our thoughts, when wee can ſay to our thoughts, when wee go to pray, Stir not, before I have done my prayer: And ſo in other holy duties, for outward actions, moral principles and motives are ſtrong enough to keep them in awe, but nothing, ſave grace, will fix the thoughts, and keep them unmoveable, when wee are imployed in the things of God; and indeed it is a very hard thing to fix our thoughts, when wee ſet our ſelves about the things of God, certainly carnal motives and principles cannot do it; indeed many, that to carry on their own intereſt and deſignes, are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and ſeem to be very fervent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive upon the things of God; yet hee is but like one that uſeth Spectacles, hee fixes not his thoughts upon thoſe ſpirituall duties he makes uſe of, but looks through them, and beyond them, upon the things
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170460:20"/>of the world, Religion, that ſeemes ſo nigh their eye, doth not terminate, but tranſmit their ſight; or they are like one that looks upon their own face in a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, they look not on the glaſs, but on themſelves: So theſe men eye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and make uſe of Religion, but as a glaſs to dreſs themſelves by, that they and their deſignes may appear more beautiful, and lovely.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that meditation is a duty of ſo much difficulty, ſince the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is tranſacted in our thoughts; in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal prayer the difficulty is leſs, becauſe our very ſpeaking doth help ſomewhat to fix our thoughts, but in meditation, where there is <hi>altum ſilentium,</hi> and nothing to give bounds to our thoughts, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject to wander; and therefore this is ſo ſtrong an argument, of an excellent frame of heart, becauſe it is ſcarce poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have our hearts fix'd upon God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept wee attain to the love and admiration of him: The Angels being flames of love, it makes them alwayes look upon the face of God, and alſo, becauſe they ſee God with admiration; for it is ſaid, they behold his face, therefore they are not weary of looking on him.</p>

                  <p>NOw I ſhall ſhew you wherein the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Holineſs conſiſts, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral graces. 1. <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Faith to be no more, though one has never ſo ſtrong reaſons for any reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truth, than if one had none: 'Tis an hard thing, when reaſon proves any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, to keep it from having domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over our faith, and not to make it the foundation of our aſſent, when the light of Faith is like that of the Sun, and Reaſon like that of the Candle: For when the Sun ſhines very bright, though it does not put out the candle, yet it makes its light uſeleſs; for wee are ſo far from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the light of the candle then, that wee can ſcarce ſee the light of the candle: For faith, though it puts not out reaſon, yet it ſees not by its light: We muſt deale with reaſon, as <hi>Moſes</hi> dealt with the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> he made them hewers of Wood, and drawers of Water, but wee muſt not make it of our counſel in the things of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170460:21"/>God; wee may uſe it to direct us in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters, as how to build Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but wee muſt not let it vote with Faith; for though reaſon is not to be deſtroyed, yet it is to be led captive, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. If wee had a friend, whoſe teſtimony wee did almoſt infallibly believe, wee would not ſtir out of our doores to ſatisfie our ſelves in any thing that hee affirmed, but if wee had any thing to do upon it, wee would preſently do it, without further inquiry, whether the thing was as hee affirmed; as if wee were to take a journey, when ſuch an one called upon us as hee rid by, if our friend told us, that hee was come whom wee expected, wee would not go to ſee, but put on our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and prepare for our journey, &amp;c. So thoſe things that wee know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as that, things that are uniſons or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apaſons, if you ſtrike the one, the other moves; 'tis true, wee may enquire after the reaſon to ſatisfie our ſelves of the why, which <hi>Mercenius Martinius</hi> hath ſet down, but wee do not enquire whether it be ſo or no; nay, whatſoever reaſon contradicts the being, ſo wee diſcard as ſpurious and falſe; ſo we ſhould do in Faith, whatſoever
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170460:21"/>contradicts the Truths of God ought to be ſuppreſt or rejected, ſo did <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond high Act of Faith, is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve truths, when carnal reaſon is, and experience alſo ſeems to be againſt it; and it is a queſtion, whether is hardeſt, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truths of God firmly, becauſe God hath ſaid them, when reaſons are for or againſt them: Little queſtion it is, but it is an eaſier thing to give our aſſent, when reaſon is for them, but ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that flowes from reaſon is not Faith; For it is not alwayes a divine aſſent that is given to divine truths; in this caſe, more bleſſed is hee that ſees not, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, as our Saviour ſaith, as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr ſaid, <hi>I cannot diſpute, but I can die for the truth:</hi> 'Tis ſingular, when Faith can lead reaſon captive, and ride in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: Certainly that of the Apoſtle is ſingular in this caſe, that <hi>wee have a ſure word of Prophecy.</hi> Thus alſo did <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth is, there were two main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that reaſon might bring againſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> having a ſon, one was the weakneſs of his own body, the other was the deadneſs of <hi>Sarahs;</hi> For <hi>Sarah</hi> was not only barren, by reaſon of ſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170460:22"/>but dead, by reaſon of age; but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did not onely not yeeld to theſe objections of humane reaſon, but did not think them conſiderable, when they ſpoke one thing, and Faith another; for ſo 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not conſider, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19.</p>
                  <p>And as it is evident, that when the Sun ſhines in its brightneſs, the light of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle addes not to its light, nay, though a room had many candles in it, the room is not ſenſibly the lighter, when the Sun ſhines full into it: So though many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do give light to a revealed truth, yet when once the authority of God gives te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to it, the brightneſs and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his teſtimony is ſo great, that whereſoever it hath its full efficacy, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon neither addes nor takes from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and evidence of thoſe truths ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and ſo believed.</p>

                  <p>FOr the high Acts of Hope may bee gueſt at by that which hath been ſaid of Faith; for as hee whoſe Faith is above all but Scripture. Arguments bee they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtrong to prove the truth hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and victorious over all objections are againſt it, and believes no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thoſe arguments, nor leſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thoſe objections; ſo his hope anchors upon the true rock, who truſts God no more when hee hath abundance, nor leſs, when hee hath no meanes; nay, when all meanes are againſt that which hee hopes for, it is a hard thing to decide, whether of theſe two are moſt difficult, <hi>viz.</hi> for him to truſt that God will give him the victory, that hath an Army of ten thouſand, to fight againſt a hundred, for him that hath an army but of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and is to fight againſt an army of ten thouſand, there is but little queſtion, but hee that hath a vaſt army againſt a handful of men, will be more confident
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170460:23"/>of getting the victory, but not that God will give him the victory; for it is very hard to have an arme of fleſh, and not to truſt in it; therefore we are not to judge of our hope by the meaſure, but by the ground of our confidence, and the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſhould put to our ſelves, is not how much, but why wee believe wee ſhould have ſuch a mercy; nay, the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wee are, the leſs wee may bee ſaid to hope, in a Scripture ſenſe, if our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence bee built on a carnal foundation, the greater ſuch our confidence is, when we have abundance of means, as our hope is leſs, even then when wee are moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, ſo it will appear when means fail; for as hypocriſie ends in Apoſtacy, ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and preſumption in diſpair, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believes in hope, muſt believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hope, as <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.18. thoſe things that are againſt carnal hope, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not a Saint from true hope.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing whereby wee may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſtrength of our hope, is, when we can truſt God in the midſt of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſcoveries of his wrath, and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and when wee have not the leaſt ſenſe of his love: Our bleſſed Saviour,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170460:23"/>the King of Saints, not onely in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that hee governs, but that hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels them alſo, as much in the Acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and riches of his Grace, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his wiſdome, as <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory, did the meaneſt of his Subjects in riches and wiſdome: I ſay, this our bleſſed Saviour gives us a rare example of an high act of hope, in this reſpect, for when hee was under the ſharpeſt ſenſe of the wrath of God, and of Gods forſaking him, yet, even then hee commends his ſpirit into the hands of God; <hi>Into thy hand, I will commend my ſpirit;</hi> for ſo is the original, and it is, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, <hi>Father, though thou ſeemeſt to forſake me, and that thou wilt not own me, yet I will commend my ſpirit.</hi> I dare, I do, I will commend my ſpirit into thy hands, though thou ſeem'ſt to forbid mee, as much as ſenſe of wrath can do, and though by thus forſaking of mee, thou ſeem'ſt as though thou would not receive my ſpirit, though I commend it into thy hand, yet I will commend it; this was the higheſt act of hope that ever was ſince the world began, and fully to truſt God, when as to our ſenſe and feeling, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170460:24"/>us, and not to caſt away our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when God ſeems to caſt away us, is an argument of an high degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. <hi>In the love of God in, four particulars.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AS for the love of God, the high acts of that are:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not much to reliſh the love that any bears us, except it be for Gods ſake; for wee muſt not bee content that any one ſhould terminate his love in us, no more than his praiſe; wee ſhould in this caſe ſay as the Angel did to <hi>John, mutatis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis, See thou doeſt it not, I am thy fellow ſervant, love God.</hi> The love which is borne us not for Gods ſake, offends God, why ſhould it not offend us? For it is our duty to love God in all things, for all things, and above all things: The truth is, wee may delight in theſe, becauſe it is that which God requires of them, that they ſhould love us: but if wee know that it is no way in reference to God, wee ought
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170460:24"/>alſo to diſreliſh it upon that account. Thoſe that preach Chriſt out of envy, the Apoſtle ſayes, hee did rejoyce, and would rejoyce, but it was, that Chriſt was preached, not that hee was preached out of envy, that doubtleſs was ſome trouble to him; one may delight in the love of Wife, Children, Friends, &amp;c. but it ſhould be a grief to us, that it ſhould be any way proportionable to that love which they ſhould bear to Chriſt. Indeed thus farre we may rejoyce in their love, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe by that meanes wee have a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to make our ſpirituall adviſes, and inſtructions, and diſcourſes of the things of God more pleaſant. Hence it is that the Apoſtle doth endeavour <hi>captare bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentiam,</hi> to gain the hearts of thoſe to whom hee wrote or preach'd; but it was, that hee might gain them, not to himſelf, but to Chriſt. From hence it is, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ought accordingly to endeavour to gain the hearts of thoſe over whom God hath placed them, that hee entring in and having a place in their hearts himſelfe, may have the better opportunity of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Chriſt alſo.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond high degree of love, is, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170460:25"/>to be acted by, then to act love; when wee have love, as wee are ſaid to have an ague, or a fever, which rather indeed have us, than wee them; and the Spouſe doth call it, being ſick of love, not that Love is a diſtemper, or a diſeaſe, but that as a diſeaſe to our hurt, ſo the love of God rules us, and over-powers us for our good; ſo that to ſay properly, Love is not ſo truly in us, as wee in love, when love is turned into raviſhments of ſpirit; and therefore the third excellency of love, is, when it conſtrains us, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, when wee neither can, nor will ſtand out againſt the power of Love; 'tis ſaid of Chriſt, that hee was driven into the Wilderneſs by the Spirit, in one Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt; in another, that hee was led, to ſhew, that hee went willingly, yet with ſo much ſpeed, as if hee had been driven: As long as thou canſt rule thy love to God, thy love as yet hath not come to that height, and paroxiſme, that it ought to do; for whereſoever the love of God is, it ought to rule the ſoul in which it dwells; for as before regeneration, corruption gives laws to the whole man, and carries it whether ſoever he pleaſes, ſo that hee cannot ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170460:25"/>much as bridle it; ſo after regeneration, love ſhould be the chief Monarch.</p>
                  <p>The fourth excellency of Love, is, when it makes us to triumph in and over difficulties, and dangers, and ſufferings: It was an high act of Chriſts love to us, when his love made him more complain, until he ſuffered, than when hee ſuffered upon the Croſſe: I have a Baptiſme to bee baptized withal, and how am I ſtreightned, until it be accompliſhed: Hee thought it long while hee ſuffered, not when hee ſuffered: Wee read of thoſe that rejoyced more in the ſpoiling of their goods, than others do in great ſpoils: So the Apoſtles, that they were thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer for Chriſt; they took an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pride in their ſhame, and pleaſure in their pains: When dangers and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings threaten us in the wayes of God, we ſhould do as the Saints did in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Church,</hi> when the wilde beaſts were let looſe upon them, they came with ſtretch'd-out armes to meet, and as it were imbrace them: Wee ſhould bee glad of having any opportunity to expreſs our love to God; 'tis a poor thing, when we ſerve God onely of that which coſt us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170460:26"/>Wee read of a woman, who in the time of perſecution, came running all undreſt, and they ask'd her, what ſhee meant, and ſhee ſaid, 'twas for fear ſhe ſhould come too late, to ſuffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for that day there were divers that were put to death for Chriſt, and ſhee came, leſt ſhee ſhould looſe that Crown.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Then love is ſtrong, when wee can love God, when there is nothing elſe to love but God, when hee ſtrips us of all his bleſſings, and let's Satan looſe upon us, as hee did upon <hi>Job;</hi> nay, when hee does not ſo much as leave us his love to love him for, but takes away the ſenſe of that alſo, ſhuts out our prayers, runs on us like a Giant, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, when wee ſee nothing but his frowns, his wrath, when our enjoyments are gone, our hopes gone, nothing left, but a ſad expectation, and fearful looking for of Judgement, and fiery wrath of God; for a ſoul in this caſe yet to love God, as thoſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion do, they will not ſin againſt God for a world; nay, that which makes Hell terrible to them, is, that if they go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhall blaſpheme him there.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:170460:26"/>
                  <p>I have heard of one, that when God delivered her out of her deſertions, ſhee acknowledged, that when ſhee was in them, as ſhee has been going along in the ſtreet, ſhee expected every ſtep to ſink down into hell; yet, if ſhee had heard but an oath ſworn, ſhee was ready to fall down dead, it was ſuch an horror and abomination to her to hear God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured. 'Tis reported of another, who being ask'd what hee would do, if God ſhould caſt him down into hell, hee anſwered, that hee had two armes, the one of faith, the other of love, and hee would imbrace him, ſo that hee would carry him with him, and then Hell would bee Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another great act of love, is, when one hath all things and God, with God, yet to love nothing but God, this is that excellent frame of ſpirit, that they in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have, that though there be ſo many rare and wonderful enjoyments, ſuch as the leaſt whereof would aſtoniſh and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh us, yet they no way divert the thoughts, or abate the love of thoſe that are in Heaven; and indeed therefore it is, that God hath reſerved thoſe joyes in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170460:27"/>abundance for that place; for if God ſhould vouchſafe us to ſee and hear thoſe things that they ſee and hear, they would bee temptations to us, inſtead of bleſſings, and wee ſhould fall in love with Heaven, more than God, or elſe wee ſhould bee paſt hope, or ſome other way be diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered; for ſo it had been with <hi>Paul,</hi> if God had not ſent him a meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, it had been better for him to have wanted thoſe revelations; but they in Heaven are able to bear that weight of glory, which would ſink us, but it is but their balaſt, and makes them more ſteady in their joyes; That wine that does but refreſh a Giant, would diſtemper a childe, that which makes him more active, will lay a childe aſleep, and wholly diſable him: It ſeems it may bee to ſome an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matter to bee patient, and holy under great afflictions; but doubtleſs, it requires more grace to be ſo in the time of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. When wee are rather paſſive than active in our knowledge, when the thoughts of God alwayes end in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and adorings of him; and in ſuch a caſe the underſtanding rather ſuffers than acts, as it were, ceaſing from its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and ſuffering it ſelf to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the object: It is <hi>quaſi ſilentium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus,</hi> or admiration.</p>
                  <p>When the truths of God are to us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes like a great Ocean, whereof wee can neither fathom the bottom, nor ſee the ſhore.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then our knowledge is excellent, when it never comes with light alone, but alwayes comes with flames, when our hearts are as much raviſh'd with the exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of love, as the underſtanding is filled with admiration of the truths: Thoſe that are in love, ſeldome ſpeak or think of their beloved, without flames; and ſhall wee bee ſuch Tinder to the dark beauty of the world? and ſhall wee lye frozen in the midſt of the glowing coales
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170460:28"/>of his mercies, and the flame of his love and excellency.</p>
                  <p>Then 3. The truths of God have wrought a perfect work in us, when the doors of our hearts are not only opened by underſtanding of them, but are lifted off from their Hinges, by admiration, ſo that they ſtand open now, and wee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can, nor will think of any thing but God; ſo that wee need not ſet our ſelves ſolemnly to think of him, or elſe wee can have no thought of him that affect us; but our hearts are ſo fixt upon the thoughts of him, that nothing can divert us, as <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> not the Angels of Heaven, no, nor Chriſt, untill hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to bee Chriſt, could have any thing from her, <hi>But they have taken away my Lord:</hi> That ſoul is in a good frame, that has its door ſhut to the world, ſo that the thoughts thereof muſt firſt knock, and ask leave, before they can enter, but open to God, ſo that the thoughts of him may come in when they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Than the Knowledge of the things of God, has obtained a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of perfection, when temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170460:28"/>cannot ſtand before it; but if in the midſt of a temptation, the thoughts of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny divine truth comes in, the temptation flies before it: The Truths of God have never yet attained to any conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that authority they ought to have over us, when temptations, and they can both be in the ſoul together, when a temptation can go on, inticing the Soul to ſin, while the truths of God look it in the very face, when a Father cannot by his looks, or threats, or calling for, or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the rod, rule his children, unleſs hee chaſtiſe them, it ſhewes hee hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt, or never had that authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, that hee ſhould: So when the conſideration of the truths and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God will not keep us in awe, but wee go on ſinning in the preſence of ſuch truths, it ſhewes, they have little power over us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Then our Knowledge is as it ſhould bee, when the truths wee know have that weight with us, that they ſink down into our hearts; nay, when wee care to have nothing to do with ſuch truths, as have nothing to do with the heart, but are meerly ſpeculative, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170460:29"/>float in the underſtanding. Some have that vaine, and ſinful art, of beating the weighty truths of God ſo thin and fine, that it cannot ſink down into their hearts, as one may beat lead ſo thin, that one may make a boat of it, that it ſhall not onely float it ſelf, but ſhall keep other things from ſinking.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="5">5. FOr Humility, the excellent degrees of that are theſe: 1. When wee ſtand wondring at the goodneſs of God, even in the leaſt mercies, when wee can admire and bleſſe God for having ſo much, which others of our degree ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, murmure againſt God for having no more, when wee are ſo ſenſible of our own vileneſs, that the leaſt temporal bleſſings ſeem wonders of mercy to us; and when God layes upon us never ſo great a weight of affliction, yet even then wee can admire his mercies, and bleſſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170460:29"/>him more, that wee are not in a worſe condition, than murmure that wee are ſo bad, and cry out, it is his mercy that wee are not conſumed; when Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies humble thee, and Gods afflictions fill thee with his praiſes, when thou canſt ſee thine own vileneſs, in the midſt of Gods mercies, and Gods goodneſs in the midſt of thine afflictions, and bee power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affected with them, then thy heart is in a right frame. A ſinner that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mures on this ſide of Hell, if hee were truly ſenſible of his own vileneſs, were as great a prodigy, and would argue as much impudency and arrogancy, as for a pardoned Traitor (who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be tortured to death with the exquiſiteſt tortours) to complain of the Kings cruelty, becauſe hee did not feed him, and cloath him deliciouſly, ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly every day, ſo for a living man to complain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When wee are unwilling that any one ſhould have good thoughts of us, or at leaſt in reference to our ſelves; and if it were not for the duty wee owe to truth, the glory of God, and the edification of our brethren, wee would never vindicate
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170460:30"/>our ſelves from any ſlander or aſperſion that is laid upon us: Many do with ſo much violence and impetuouſneſs vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves, that they doe wound their own conſciences, and bring a greater ſcandal upon Religion, by their unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian carriage, in vindicating themſelves, than the crime, which was unjuſtly laid to their charge, would have done, had they been guilty of it; like one, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to rub off a ſpot of duſt caſt on his face, ſhould rub off the skin alſo, and ſo leave behinde a greater blemiſh than he removed. Wee ought humbly and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to deny thoſe crimes which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly laid to our charge, this duty wee owe to Truth, and to Religion, which may alſo ſuffer by our ſufferings, this way; but then wee muſt alſo remember to perform that duty wee owe to Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and patience, which is quietly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to be content, that any, or all, ſhould think as ill of us, as they pleaſe, and think thus with our ſelves, that the ſhame that lights on us, by being ſuppoſed to have committed the crimes wee are guiltleſs of, is not to be compared to that which is due to us for thoſe ſins which wee are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170460:30"/>guilty of, though men know them not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another ſingular Act of Humility, is, to bee troubled at all unjuſt praiſes, as much as others are at unjuſt ſlanders. Surely the one is as much againſt truth, as the other; nay, though the praiſes be due to us, if they be given us upon a wrong ground, or from a wrong end, wee ought to reject them: So our Saviour blamed the young man for calling of him good, though hee was ſo; yet, becauſe the young man not thinking of him to bee God, ſaid, <hi>he was Good.</hi> So our Saviour at another time rejected Satans confeſſing of him to be the Son of God, and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> telling of him, that hee was one that accepted the perſon of no man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, though their praiſes were true and excellent, yet their ends were malicious; wee ſhould bee more afraid of juſt praiſes, then of unjuſt reproofs, for they are more likely to do us harme; but praiſes and gifts are ſeldome ſent back from what hand ſoever they come, or for what end ſoever they are ſent.</p>
                  <p>The fourth act of humility, is, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do what others will have us do, if they carry on their commands with love
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170460:31"/>and meekneſs, but when they carry it on with imperiouſneſs and violence; divers think it no crime, but gallantry of ſpirit, to profeſs that ſuch a one may do any thing in love, but if they go about to force them, then they ſhall rather break than bend their ſpirits: but to bee flexible to imperious commands and violence, is a better ſign of that humility and meekneſs of ſpirit that ſpeaks a true Chriſtian; for wee have a Proverb, though not true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally yet proverbially is, <hi>viz.</hi> The devil is good, if he be pleaſed; for though the devil is never good, and worſe to thoſe that pleaſe him, yet there are few men that are come to that height of wickedneſs, that if one uſeth them with abundance of love, kindneſs, intreaties, gifts, praiſes, &amp;c. you may much prevail with them; nay, it is not eaſie to perſwade divers that this is a vice in them, <hi>viz.</hi> that they will not bee ruled but by love; but St. <hi>Peter</hi> is clear as to ſervants, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. that they ought not only to obey Kind and loving Maſters, but froward and imperious; and as for others, our Saviour ſpeaks plain, that not onely wee ſhould go a mile or two with thoſe that entreat us, but thoſe that compell us to go one mile, to go
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170460:31"/>with them twain; and ſo alſo, that wee ſhould not only lend to thoſe that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to borrow our Cloak, but to give it to them that demand it, as their own. I know there are divers caſes and excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherein theſe rules hold not, yet none of thoſe exceptions are grounded upon this, that they ſhall not have their will, but I will have my will; I grant, that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, Maſters, Parents, &amp;c. rather to correct, than to yeeld to the imperiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe that are under them; but neither they, nor any other ſhould do it upon the account of wilfulneſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from all that hath been ſaid, I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a greater act of humility and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, to yeeld to the imperious demands and commands of others, than to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties: Chriſtians ſhould not bee like flints, that caſt out fire, as often as you ſtrike them, to break them, and thoſe are generally the greateſt fools in Chriſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that uſe to ſay, <hi>you ſhall not think to make a fool of mee;</hi> but true Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſo ſhamefully mangled and disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by thoſe diſtinctions, and diſtorted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, that pride and paſſion, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and ambition have made, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170460:32"/>there is little of its native, genuine, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and beauty remains.</p>
                  <p>The fifth high act of humility, is, when it doth not hinder the edification of others, to love our own abaſement, and diſrepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that the glory of God may bee more exalted, and that our neighbour may bee prefer'd before us; for though in the matter of our ſoules wee are to love our ſelves before any particular perſon, and generally in other caſes, to love our neighbour, but as our ſelves, yet in the point of honour, wee are to prefer them before us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. for wee are not onely to bee content that wee are valued and eſteemed leſs than others, but wee are to take much ſatisfaction in it, ſince it is the accompliſhment of that which wee do, or ought to deſire, in ſhame, that wee ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, wee ought to magnifie God, that for his ſake hee will account us worthy to ſuffer ſuch things; for the shame that accompanies divers afflictions, wee ought to receive it with the ſame patience, ſatisfaction, and thankſgiving, as wee do the affliction which it accompanieth; hee that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth none, yet deſpiſeth the world, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170460:32"/>himſelf, and deſpiſeth, that hee is deſpiſed, is a perfect man.</p>
                  <p>To make my meaning plain, I will give you ſome inſtances; there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kindes of afflictions, or troubles, ſome that are honourable, and ſome that are dishonourable, one hath a great ſcar in his face, by which its very much disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which was got in war, and is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his valour; another like disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by the Small Pox; one is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and hath taunting expreſſions given by his Parents, or Maſter, another hath the like from an equal and companion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one accounts it no dishonour for him to bear the former, but amongſt gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, it is accounted cowardize to bear the latter; but it is a greater act of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and more acceptable to God, to bear the latter, than the former, ſince in the former wee bear but one affliction, <hi>viz.</hi> the paſſion and anger of a Superiour, but in the latter, the shame alſo, that follows our bearing ſuch expreſſions; ſurely, if Chriſt made himſelf of no reputation, we should more than ſubmit, when God makes us of no reputation; one hath a Boil on his arm, another, on his face, the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170460:33"/>pain is the ſame in both, but that on the face much more shame; and when God ſends us ſuch an one, wee should know that God intends that wee should as well welcome the shame as the pain: there are ſome vertues and graces more eſteemed of in the world, than others; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, valour, liberality, eſpecially to the poor, ſuffering perſecution for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake, are generally more eſteemed of, than many acts of humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, modeſty, patience, and ſelf-denial, for one that is noble by birth, or of great eſtate, and honours, not to follow the vain cuſtome of the world, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of richneſs, or fashion of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, or in curioſity in dreſſing her ſelf, but to go in a mean, careleſs, and not vainly fashionable, though not ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly: Dreſſe is an act of humility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe deſpiſed, and an act of obedience, becauſe commanded, yet this act of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, as I have ſaid, is deſpiſed; but if the ſame perſon should go to the houſes of poor people, and confer with them, and relieve them, that act of humility and charity is magnified, for divers times ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral acts of the ſame grace, ſome of them
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170460:33"/>more, and ſome leſs honourable: As for example, ſome great perſon is in deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſeveral Miniſters go to comfort her, and no one wonders that ſuch a one goes to that great perſon, but rather hath a greater eſteem of him, that hee hath an intereſt in a perſon of that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but if ſome poor women were talking of Chriſt in the ſtreets, and ſome Miniſter should joyn in diſcourſe with them, as Chriſt did with them that were going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> if hee were an eminent Miniſter, they would wonder what hee did ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that woman, as the Diſciples did with Chriſts ſpeaking with the woman of <hi>Samaria;</hi> and if it were a Miniſter of ſmall account, and eſtate, though of great piety, they would look upon it as amar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and effect of his mean condition; <hi>but wiſdome is juſtified of her children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Divers times, by ſome inconſiderable acts of foolery or indiſcretion, wee bring ſhame upon our ſelves; ſo that though there bee no ſin in the acts themſelves, yet the duty wee owe to civility and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſhould make us abſtain from doing of them, yet when they are done, wee ſhould not at all bee troubled at the ſhame
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170460:34"/>that followes them; nay, in thoſe actions that are ſinful, though wee ought ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſenſibly to be affected with the guilt of that ſin, yet for the ſhame that comes upon us, by reaſon of it, we ought willingly to accept, as part of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſin, not that it is not lawful, for it is our duty to ſeek out for remedy, for a Boil in the face, or any other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful affliction, as well as of others that are not diſgraceful; but my meaning is, that while the affliction continues, wee ſhould not be troubled at the diſgrace it brings: Our Saviour did both endure the Croſſe, and deſpiſe the ſhame, and which was hardeſt, it is not eaſily diſcern'd. I think it is eaſier to deny our profit or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than to deny our honour; pride is the laſt ſin wee put off, for wee may bee proud even of humility it ſelf; yet though the outward acts of humility may nouriſh it, yet the inward grace and acts of humility, will mortifie it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond high degree of holineſs
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170460:35"/>in the times of affliction, is, not only to bee patient under them, but thankful for them; for wee pay a Phyſitian for his advice, and an Apothecaries Bill, as well for bitter Pills, as for Cordials; wee do not ſay, ſince you preſcribe mee bitter Pills, I will not give you ſo much for your skill and advice, nor you for your drugs, as if they were more pleaſing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, but wee pay indifferently for both: So <hi>Job, The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; bleſſed bee the Name of the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>ANotheract of the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is, to project, contrive, and plot how wee may advance the glory of God more: It is not enough for us to do the thing that lyes before us, and to go, as it were, in a road, but to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and enquire, if there bee any way of edifying our Brethren, and glorifying God more, than yet wee have knowne, not that I am for waves of will-worſhip, and inventions of men, as for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods Worſhip: Of that, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anon; but that which I would have, is to enquire, and conſider, how wee may do that which God commands

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:170460:38"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed of judging thy ſelf by the degrees, not the truth of grace, it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of Satan to make thee ſtand gazing upon the rare manifeſtations, comforts, and graces of others, when thereby hee cauſes thee to diſpond, and even to give quite off, becauſe thou think'ſt thou ſhalt never attain that degree of holineſs. There are two baſe carnal ingredients that make up this temptation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Pride, Wilt thou not ſerve God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee will put thee in that higheſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? Canſt thou not be content to bee a door-keeper in the Houſe of God? It is an holy frame of heart to mourn for the weakneſs of our graces, but it is a carnall one to murmure or diſpond.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond carnal ingredient, is, that wee diſtruſt God, who made the tongue; though thou art like <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſlow of ſpeech, yet God can make thee like to <hi>Paul, My Grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Paul;</hi> and ſo it is with thee; it is a deluſion, ſomewhat like that which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan uſes, to hinder us from believing our juſtification: What art thou, ſaith Satan, and carnall conſcience, that God ſhould juſtifie thee, or love thee, or give thee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170460:38"/>ſuch great things as thou expecteſt: But Faith anſwers, Since I come to God in Chriſts Name, it is not for mee to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in my ſelf how hee loves mee, but how hee loves Chriſt; nor is it for mee to conſider, as to juſtification, what I have done or ſuffer'd, or what I am, but what Chriſt hath done; and as long as thou look'ſt upon thy graces to juſtifie thee, or thine own ſtrength to ſanctifie thee, it is no marvell that thou diſpaireſt, of both, That which thou art to do in this caſe is:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To bleſs God for the graces and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that hee hath given to others; it was a ſpiritual frame of heart that hee had, or at leaſt a ſpiritual ſpeech of him, who when hee was upon his death bed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to apply the promiſes of the Goſpel to himſelf, but could not, as hee thought, yet he bleſſed God, that he had made ſuch precious promiſes for others to apply, though hee could not; ſo thy deſign, being that God ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, thou should'ſt rejoyce that others do it, though thou canſt not; ſpirituall envy is the worſt kinde of envy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou art to imitate them in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:170460:39"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou art to ſtrengthen thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and hope, for they were hewen out of the ſame rock with thee, their hearts were as hard by nature as thine; it is a comfort to one, to know that ſuch an one, as was cur'd by ſuch a Phyſitian, had the ſame diſeaſe as wee have, it makes us to rejoyce, to ſee how well hee is, and to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to his Phyſitian, it doth not encreaſe our ſorrowes or fears of our recovery, but our joyes, to think, that if he were cured, wee may.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thou muſt deſire that holineſs thou canſt not attain to, that is not the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Gods people, to ſay, What needs ſo much holineſs? if thou doſt not hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, it proceeds not, becauſe thou art full of grace, but corruption.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Prize holineſs, have high thoughts of it, and ſee beauty in it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Mourn for the want of it, and then if thy judgement doth prize, if thy heart doth deſire, if thine eye doth mourn, if thine endeavours doth follow hard after God, though thou canſt not attain to bee ſo eminent a Chriſtian as others, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, that Chriſt will not quench ſuch
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170460:39"/>ſmoaking flax, nor break ſuch a bruiſed reed, as thou art; and know this for thy comfort, that the weakeſt faith doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, not only as well, but as much as the ſtrongeſt, and that the weakeſt grace is as ſure to perſevere as the ſtrongeſt; for it is not by the power of our graces, but by the mighty power of God to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; God keeps us not only through faith, but hee keeps our faith alſo; hee gives us not only remiſſion of ſinnes, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but hee gives us repentance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>The ſecond Caution, That wee ſhould take heed that the works of our General Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, juſtle not out the works of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular calling.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="2">2. ANother thing that you are to take heed of, is, that the works of your general, doth not juſtle out the works of your particular calling; grace doth not hinder, but ſanctifieth our lawful worldly imployments, it makes us perform them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170460:40"/>upon more ſpiritual motives, and from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principles, and for higher ends, but it makes us not leave them off, there is a temptation that divers young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Chriſtians are exerciſed withall, <hi>viz.</hi> in the midſt of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary works of their calling, they are preſs'd to leave off, and go to prayer; indeed this is a good ſign; but it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as Phyſitians ſay, that the ſwelling of the legs after a great fit of ſickneſſe, is a good ſign, though ſuch ſwellings are to bee cured alſo; ſo it is generally a good ſign to ſee people forward, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unſeaſonably in the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for few unregenerated perſons are troubled with this kind of temptation; yet this diſtemper is not to bee cheriſhed, nor accounted health: Therefore, ſince, becauſe many times the Spirit of God may extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily ſtir us up to prayer: It is worth conſidering, how to know, whether it is the Spirit of God, or a deluſion of Satan, when wee are moved to this duty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt, if thou art moved to prayer on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when thou art imployed upon the works of thy particular calling, but never upon vacant times, it is very likely to be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170460:40"/>a deluſion of Satan, for Satans way is not to cure idleneſs with duties, but to ſpoil one duty with another, to put thee upon duties that are unſeaſonable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thine imployments, or unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thy gifts; or ſuch an one, that thou art not warranted to by thy calling.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Art thou inlarged in prayer, when thou art put thus extraordinarily upon duties, or not? God doth ſeldome give one a call to any imployment, but hee gives one gifts ſuitable to it; as hee doth not lay any affliction on us, but what he doth enable us to bear; ſo hee puts us not upon any imployment, but hee ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to perform it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed God ſometimes may give one the will to do a duty, and not give him the deed; but that is very rarely, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally; to teach us that truth, that the ſtrength of our own reſolutions is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to carry us thorough the doing of good, or reſiſting evil: Yet one thing is to bee conſidered, that thou may'ſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in prayer, both by God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: But the difference is, when God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth thee, it is in the fervency of thy deſires, but when Satan, it is only in the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170460:41"/>fluency of thy expreſſions; when God enlarges thee, thou art humbled after thine enlargements; when Satan, thou art puft up.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What power and efficacy has thy prayer upon thee? The prayer of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man is not only fervent, during the time of prayer, but effectual afterwards; and that not onely by prevailing with God, but prevailing with thy ſelf, it makes thee more watchful, and induſtrious; as for example, if thou prayeſt that God would enable thee to ſerve him, if it bee a right prayer, it will make thee more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, more watchful over thy wayes, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayer is interpretatively a vow, which obliges us to perform it; therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what power and influence thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have upon thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How is it with thee upon the Lords Day? If the Spirit of God moves thee to duties on the week daies; thou wilt bee much more in the Spirit on the Lords Day.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>TAke heed of degenerating into will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, to ſtudy plots, and contrive how to ſerve God better, is a ſingular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and act of piety, but then ſee the Word of God bee your rule; for elſe to invent wayes of worſhip, that God hath not commanded, or warranted in his Word, though they ſeem never ſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and have never ſo great a ſhew of humility, they puff thee up, and provoke God: One hath this ſimile, A certain great man had thirty ſervants, ten of them were natural fools, and had not wiſdome to judge of, or to alter their Lords directions; the ſecond ten had ſome meaſure of underſtanding, but were proud and arrogant, ſo that they would oftentimes, becauſe they ſaw not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Lords directions, (for the depths of his wiſdome were too great for them to fathom) would follow their own inventions, which being but vain, they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170460:42"/>ſpoiled the work which the Lord ſet them about, and ſo provoked their Lord, not only by ſpoiling the buſineſs hee imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in, but much more, by their judging his wayes to be fooliſh; the third ten ſervants, were thoſe, who had far more wiſdome than the ſecond, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed it to alter their Lords directions, alwayes judging them to be beſt, though they many times could ſee no reaſon for it, nay, much againſt it. The high thoughts of their Lords wiſdome firſt cauſed them not to alter his inſtructions, and afterwards, their own frequent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the betterneſs of his wayes. The firſt ten are natural agents, which work, but they know not what, rather by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, than by underſtanding; the ſecond ten are wicked men, who judging of the wayes of Gods Worſhip, by naturall reaſon, to which many of his wayes ſeem abſurd, they would therefore alter them, and inſtitute others, of their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that carry a fairer ſhew to human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo they mightily provoke God. For to break Gods Law, may bee an act of infirmity, but to judge his Law, is arrogancy: The laſt ten are the people
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170460:42"/>of God, who have wiſdome, and more wiſdome than the former, but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſe their wiſdome in judging of Gods wayes, and finding out new wayes and worſhip, for they know that God never gave them their reaſon for that end, but only to help them to judge of the things of the world as how to build houſes, and how to finde out wayes for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other manufactures, and things of that nature, that are temporal, and not ſpiritual.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="4">4. ANother errour and miſtake of new converted Chriſtians, is, to over-burden themſelves with duties for Satan, when he ſees that hee cannot keep them any longer from the wayes of God, then hee doth endeavour to put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on religious duties, as they ſeem, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

                  <p>Take heed of raſh vowes, nay, take heed of all vowes, leſt they bee raſh; there are divers Chriſtians, who being unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and newly converted, have bound themſelves by vowes to ſuch a number of outward performances, as to read ſo many Chapters a day, to faſt often every week, that afterwards, when they were

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>The fifth Caution, againſt ſeveral miſtakes of the people of God, in ſpiritual joyes and ſorrowes.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="5">5. COncerning ſpiritual joyes, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are ſubject to ſeveral miſtakes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They retain all joyes that ſeem to bee ſpiritual, whereas they ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, for an enemy may put on the colour of a friend to deceive us: I will give you a few rules to judge of your joyes, whether they be ſpiritual or no:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True ſpiritual joyes, generally come from the application of ſome promiſe of Scripture, <hi>Let him kiſſe mee with the kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2 Joyes that come, wee know not whence,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170460:44"/>are very dangerous, and by experience all the people of God, can ſet their ſeal to this truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. True ſpiritual joyes generally, follow deep humiliation generally, one is a childe walking in darkneſs, before one is brought into this marvellous light, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening and the morning was the firſt day; it was the ſtony ground, that the firſt time it received the Word, it received it with joy; but the good ground brings forth fruit with patience: I know one, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as ſoon as hee began to confeſs his ſins, us'd to have joyes, but hee look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as dangerous, as coming too ſoon, before hee was in any conſiderable meaſure humbled for his ſins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. True joyes, as they generally follow humiliation, ſo they do leave us more humble, and more deſirous to ſerve God than they found us; joyes that puff up with pride, are from Satan, thoſe that build us up in holineſs, are from God; joyes that make us wanton, and care<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſs, of Gods ſervice, are ſuch joyes that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will never grudge us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They judge of their graces by their comforts, whereas conſolations are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170460:44"/>no part of, but rather a reward of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the deareſt of Gods people; nay, even Chriſt himſelf was a man acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſorrowes; and generally their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſtrongeſt, whoſe comforts are weakeſt; and your ancient Chriſtians, though they may have a ſetled ſerenity and peace, but have not ſuch extaſies and raviſhments of ſpirit, as new Converts have; God deals with new Converts, as wee deal with our little children, wee dandle them on our knees, wee play with them, and kiſs them oftne, which wee do not do, when they are grown to mans eſtate, their graces being weak, ſomething muſt bee ſtrong; therefore God gives them more comforts to ſupport them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the novelty of Religion doth much occaſion their joyes, for all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new, &amp; they are like men that come into a ſtrange country, they are very much affected with the ſtrange ſights they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, therefore do not judge of thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by thy comforts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The next errour and miſtake wee are ſubject to, is, to judge of their duties by the reliſh they finde in them, judging thoſe duties not to bee wholeſome, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170460:45"/>are not ſweet, and that God is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thoſe duties wherewith they themſelves are not pleaſed; ſurely it is an eaſier thing for a Saint to pleaſe God, than himſelf, and it were a ſad thing if God ſhould have as hard thoughts of them, as they have of themſelves; therefore to this I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That oftentimes Chriſt is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe duties that wee are aſhamed of, and mourn for; the Spouſe hides her ſelf in the clifts of the Rocks, and under the ſtairs, as a ſhame that her perſon ſhould bee ſeen, or her voice heard, yet even then Chriſt was delighted with both, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nay, there may bee much more grace in ſuch a ſoul that is conſtant in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, though hee findes no joy nor reliſh in them. For it ſhewes</p>
                  <p n="1">1. More pure love to God: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a friend deſires two to walk, and one of them takes no delight in walking, but in reſpect of ſome lameneſs, it is a trouble to him; the other friend doth very much delight in the walk it ſelf, both of them go with their friend, which of them, think you, yeelds to the deſires of his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170460:45"/>friend, out of the principles of love? when thou performeſt duty without comfort, it ſhewes, that you do love the God of conſolations; more than the conſolations of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is more pure obedience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in ſuch duties: There is a ſtory of an excellent Muſitian, who when hee was aged grew deaf, but retained his skill, and his Lute being tun'd by another, could play ſingularly well, the King would often have him to play before him: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Lutaniſt being deaf, could take no delight in his own muſick, but what he did, hee did out of obedience to the Kings command; ſo, when thou findeſt no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nor delight in thine own duties, thou doſt not do them to pleaſe thy ſelf, but to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is more humility ſhown in ſuch duties, it is an act of ſpiritual pride, as well as of diſobedience, not to ſerve God, unleſs hee will bee giving of us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: The prodigal childe thought it enough for him to bee as an hired ſervant, though hee was not entertain'd with thoſe ſmiles and expreſſions of love that a father uſes to beſtow upon his ſons; they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170460:46"/>think it a wonderful mercy, that they may, as dogs, be ſuffer'd to gather the crums under the table, and that they are not deſtroyed, as Wolves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſtians do not enough improve their joyes, but like ſome, who when they go to feaſt with their friend, take more delight in the banquet, than in their friend; therefore two wayes you are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to improve your ſpiritual joyes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Improve them, as <hi>Eſther</hi> did, take this opportunity of preſenting ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of great concernment at this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. It hath been the cuſtome of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, that when the King hath carried himſelf with moſt love and familiarity to them, to take that time to preſent their petitions unto him, what corruption wouldeſt thou have eſpecially ſubdued? Would'ſt thou have the Church deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd? or what other petition is in thy heart to ask of this nature? ask it, now God ſmiles upon thee, hee will deny thee nothing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Improve thy joyes, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did the years of plenty, lay up againſt a dear year, for thou may'ſt not expect that theſe daies ſhould alwayes laſt, therefore treaſure up
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170460:46"/>theſe experiences; write down what thoſe joys were, how it was then with thee, and how thou cam'ſt by thoſe joyes; what promiſe was it that the Spirit applied, and ſealed to thy ſoul, which hee made as a full breſt unto thee, and gave thee faith to draw forth the comforts of it; forget not the ſongs that thou haſt had in the night, and the daies, of the right hand of the moſt High, for when afterwards, when thy conſcience, or Satan ſhall queſtion thy title and intereſt, nay, God himſelf may frown upon thee, and ſeem to bee a ſwift witneſſe againſt thee, and call thee forth to bee burnt with everlaſting fire, for thy ſpiritual whoredomes and adulteries, then to have theſe evidences by thee, under Gods own hand and ſeal, will ſtand thee in great ſtead; they ſay, that when ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-dews fall, Bees do not gather, and carry any to their hives, but only feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it for the preſent, but it is that they gather from flowers, that they lay up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Winter; if <hi>Joſeph</hi> had made no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe of the times of plenty, than to make the greater feaſts, <hi>Egypt</hi> might have periſh'd in the ſeven years of dearth: take thou heed, that when theſe honey-dews
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170460:47"/>fall upon thee from heaven, take heed, that thou doſt not onely delight thy ſelf with the enjoyments of them, but enrich thy ſelf alſo with the treaſuring of them up againſt the daies of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, bee watchful, take heed that thou art not ſo buſie in taking the ſpoile, that thine enemy rallies again, gives thee a ſecond onſet; bee not ſecure in the time of joyes, or at leaſt provide for a ſharp encounter afterwards: Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our after that wonderful teſtimony from heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. laſt, was immediately led into the wilderneſſe to bee tempted of the devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his great revelations, Satan came and buffeted him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Concerning ſpiritual ſorrowes, the people of God are ſubject to many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They nouriſh them too much, they think if their ſorrowes be ſpiritual, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the object, there is no fear that the actings of their ſorrow can any other way bee carnal, nor to bee reſiſted, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited; but if any of theſe things ſhall accompany thy ſpiritual ſorrow, ſo far forth, as theſe following effects ſhall
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170460:47"/>proceed from it, it is to bee mortified.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It thy ſight of, and ſorrow for ſin, hinders thee from believing, thou art not to cheriſh, but to mortifie ſuch ſorrowes, for it is carnal; I do not ſay totally, but ſo far as it hinders thee from going unto Chriſt; for though it comes in the ſhew of humility, yet it cannot bee true humility. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though one vice be contrary to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, yet one grace is not contrary to another, true humility will keep one from preſuming, but it is pride that keeps one from believing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All true grace comes from Chriſt, from him wee receive grace for grace, but from Chriſt, doth not come any thing to hinder us from going to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the ſight and ſorrow for thy ſins hinders thee from other duties, if thy mournings for thy ſins hinder thee from family duties, from the works of thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling, if they hinder thee from prayer, or receiving the Lords Supper, I ſay, if they hinder thee either from duties or Ordinances, either by taking up all thy time, or by pleading that thou art unworthy to come into the preſence of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170460:48"/>God, when, and upon that account, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thee from coming; when hee calls thee, all ſorrow, as to theſe effects, is to bee mortified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the ſight and ſorrow for thy ſins diſcourage thee, and makes thee to think, that it is in vain, thou ſhalt never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch corruptions, ſuch ſorrow is not from God: The Apoſtle ſayes, that hee forgot the things that were behinde, in this ſenſe wee muſt forget our ſins, and forget our graces, that is, wee muſt not look upon our former ſinful life, from thence to draw ſuch ſad concluſions, that our ſins are too great to bee pardoned, or of too deep a dye to bee cleanſed, or our corruptions too ſtrong to bee conquered; neither muſt wee look upon our former duties and graces, as if now wee might ſlack our pace.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of letting the Truths of God lie looſe upon us.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe firſt great impediment of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is, that we let the truth of God lie looſe upon us, they are not faſtned by the Maſter of the Aſſemblies, as nailes in a ſure place; few there are that take up their Religion upon any other grounds, than becauſe their Parents, and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which they were born, and brought up, have, and do profeſs it: But I ſhall not proſecute this any further, ſince it is done in that ſingular book, <hi>Pinks</hi> Tryal of our ſincere love to Chriſt, few there are that do truly and really believe what they profeſs, they are rather aſham'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thoſe truths, which, all amongſt whom they live, profeſs, than that they in their hearts do believe them to bee true, which appears partly by this, that when Sects and Hereſies are multiplied, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance fall off from the truth, ſo that the ſname of holding ſuch errours is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, than they do own thoſe errours
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170460:49"/>which before they believed, but were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to profeſs, but eſpecially by this, that they deny thoſe truths by their lives and converſation, which they profeſs with their tongues; it is true, that there may bee conviction without converſion, nor can the underſtanding make the will love thoſe truths as good, which it ſelf believes as true; yet though conviction cannot work converſion, yet doubtleſs, generally it would work Reformation, the way to gain firm and ſtrong perſwaſions of the truth of God, is to build our faith upon ſtrong and irrefragable grounds, the chief, if not the onely, is the Word of God; there are too few Chriſtians, that if they were ask'd how they could prove the fundamentals of Religion, could not bring one Text of Scripture to prove them: Therefore I do adviſe all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to get two or three plain and evident places of Scripture, to eſtabliſh themſelves in every truth they hold; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I cannot but commend that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and invaluable, though low priz'd book, the Aſſemblies Confeſſion of Faith, and larger Catechiſme, for in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent thereof, are ſet down the choiceſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170460:49"/>places of Scripture, for proof of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral truths therein ſpecified.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond advice, for the getting of a firm perſwaſion of the truths of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, to begin with fundamentals; it is the devils policy to ſet us upon the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle truths of the Temple, at firſt, as ſome now do; as ſoon as they think of Religion, they enter upon the points of Election and Reprobation, by this means they are dazled, and grow giddy, and fall headlong into perdition: There are ſcarce any Arts, Trades, or Sciences, but there is a method in teaching of them, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments are firſt to be learned, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the higher truths, or practiſes; as whoſoever intending to learn upon the Lute, ſhould begin with the difficult'ſt leſſon at firſt, would bee diſcouraged and diſinabled from proceeding any farther; ſo in the truths of Religion, the plaineſt and moſt fundamentals are firſt to bee learned, and then thoſe which are leſs fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.</p>
                  <p>The third advice, is, to venture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the truths you know, and would ſtrengthen your faith in them; nay, may I ſay unto you, though you do
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170460:50"/>not believe them to bee true, but onely think that they may be true, do as thoſe do, who are deſirous to know the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of nature, if the experiment will coſt them but little, and bee of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, hee will make experiment of it: So in the myſteries of Religion, would you know whether the Doctrine of the Goſpel bee true or no? our Saviour tells how you may make the experiment, keep the Commandments of God, it will coſt you but little ſo to do, and then you ſhall know; <hi>&amp;c. John</hi> 7.17. So if you will know whether that ſaying be true, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30. make a tryal of it, leave ſomething for Chriſt, if ever occaſion bee, leave lands, houſes, &amp;c. but though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary times of perſecutions fall not in thy daies, ſo that thou ſhalt have no opportunity to make ſuch an experiment, yet leave thy luſts, and unlawful games and pleaſure, the eſteem of the world, when the truths of the Goſpel require it of thee, and try whether it ſhall not bee an hundred fold advantage to thee, even in this World; it is true, it may bee God will pay thee in Diamonds, which thou layeſt out in farthings, in peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170460:50"/>in ſpiritual graces, or comforts; whereas that which thou didſt part with for his ſake, was, it may bee, ſome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit, pleaſure, or credit, or that which is much worſe, ſome filthy luſt. But concerning further directions, for the begetting and ſtrengthening of our faith, and to preſerve us from errours, I refer the Reader to the Preface of my Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the 4, 5, 6, 7 Chapters of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi>

                  <p>THe ſecond great Impediment of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, is, want of conſideration: There are many truths, not only ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truths as the Goſpel, but even ſuch truths, that even the very Heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did, and do believe; the bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof, though it hath little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in it ſelf, yet if they were truly conſidered and improved, would bee of ſingular uſe and advantage to us, who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170460:51"/>is there amongſt us, that knows not that hee muſt die; yet how few do conſider and improve this plain truth? wee let the truths of God lie by us, and ſtore them up, as divers Ladies do their rarities and curioſities in their cloſets, onely to ſhew them to thoſe that come to ſee us; ſo wee make uſe of the truths of God, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of them, and rather as matters of oſtentation to boaſt of, and pride our ſelves in, than as things, by the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof, wee may gain everlaſting life; or as great perſons do of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, ſometimes to walk in them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the pleaſure of the beauty, and ſent of the flowers that grow there, than as the Bee doth, to draw honey from them. There was a certain Kingdome that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from their Prince, and ſtood in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen defiance againſt him, the Prince out of his great clemency, ſent a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein hee ſignified his free pardon of all thoſe that would return, and own, and obey him as their Soveraign; divers did magnifie the rareneſs of the hand, and the ſublimity and graciouſneſs of the expreſſions of this writing, many took Copies of it, and publiſh'd it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

Who is there that know not they muſt die? but who is there that conſidereth it, and the great concernment of it to themſelves and lives accordingly? this is the ſingular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of meditation, which not onely ſtrengthens our faith in the truths wee conſider, but ſhews us how much they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us; and apply them to our own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof, as is further expreſs'd and explain'd, in that ſmall Treatiſe of Meditation, which by the aſſiſtance of God I have publiſh'd, to which I refer the Reader.</p>

                  <p>ANother great impediment, is, that wee put off God with ſolemn du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as if wee ſet a part ſo much time to ſpend every day in meditations and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many think, if they do not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them, but are conſtant to their times and ſet duties, all the reſt of the day is their own, to do as they pleaſe; whereas the truth is, our morning, and other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn duties, the chief end of them is to ſet our hearts in tune, that all our words, &amp; thoughts, may be ſuch as may make ſweet muſick in the ears of God; and wee muſt not think, that as ſoon as wee have tun'd our Harps wee may hang them upon the Willowes: It is true, as I have elſwhere ſaid, ſolemn duties are acts of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God for the preſent, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helps for the communion with God for the future, as when wee are at a feaſt, wee finde reliſh and delight in the very act of eating, but the main end of our eating

                  <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>The next impediment is, carnally to think, that God will be contented with any thing.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>TO think that God will be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any thing and bee grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every minute that wee ſpend in his ſervice, this proceeds from an erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement, and from a baſe heart. Suppoſe it were ſo, that God would bee content with any thing; ſuppoſe God ſhould not bee angry, though thou ſhould'ſt not pray to him, or hear a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170460:53"/>or read a Chapter in the Bible, any more than once a year, but he ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all give thee leave to ſpend as much time in theſe duties as thou would'ſt, I ſay, if God would bee content, would'ſt thou be content? Doſt thou do ſo in any other thing? A friend, in whoſe power it is to do thee a courteſie, doſt thou ſatisfie thy ſelf in this, that hee will not bee angry, though thou doſt not ask it of him? If a great Monarch ſhould bid you ask what you would of him, would you therefore ask nothing, becauſe you were aſſur'd hee would not bee angry, though you ask'd nothing? Doth this make thee not to add to thy eſtate, when thou haſt got enough to live competently and comfortably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God doth not command thee ſo to do; but thou may'ſt juſtly think, that hee is rather angry with thee for joyning houſe to houſe, and being inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in thy deſires. Suppoſe God ſhould give the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, leave to dwell on earth again, and to give over their ſongs of joy and praiſe, which they give unto him, would they account it a priviledge? would they not rather account it an argument of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170460:53"/>of Gods love, and their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: Suppoſe a Law ſhould bee made, that whoſoever ſhould kill their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould not bee puniſhed, would any loving Mother think that ſuch a Law could bring any advantage unto her? Nay, ſuppoſe a Law ſhould bee made for the rewarding of thoſe Mothers that were careful for the good of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, would the reward promis'd in that Law, heighten her love and care to her little ones? So neither doth the promiſe of Gods pardoning of ſin incourage the people of God to ſin againſt him, but they rather fear God, and his goodneſſe; it argues neither love to God, nor to thy ſelf, to put God off with any thing, though hee would bee content with it; it is a baſe ſlaviſh queſtion, to ſay, what muſt I do and put the Emphaſis in muſt, a ſon and a friend ſay, What may I do to pleaſe my father or my friend? to cure this baſe diſtemper, you muſt underſtand the excellency of the duties you perform, do you know what it is to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God? to praiſe, admire, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him, is the happineſs of heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt know the greatneſs of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170460:54"/>the rewards that God gives to them that ſerve him, and that not one minute ſpent in his ſervice, nor one thought of love ſhall bee forgotten; hee that numbers the hairs of thy head, doth alſo keep an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſmalleſt and ſlendereſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances in his ſervice, and will certainly reward them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Above all, get the love of God, for love thinks nothing enough; our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours body was imbalmed with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound of ſpices and odours, yet <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> thinks hee had not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, ſhee brings hers alſo; it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that love never puts, What need I do ſo much? but her ſaying is alwayes, How may I do more? If you ſhould ask mee, how you may get the love of God. I anſwer, that if it were not for our baſe corruptions, I might rather ask you, how you can chuſe but love him? Sometimes of a ſudden it hath come into my minde, that if one could but ſpeak with the devil, one might perſwade him not to go about doing miſchief, damning ſoules as hee doth. I know it is a vain thought, for the Angel himſelf that diſputed with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was fain to refer
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170460:54"/>him to the Lord to rebuke him; and if the Angel could not perſwade him to leave off his idolatrous attempt, much leſs can wee: It is true, if men were not ſpiritually dead or mad, it were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but that ſuch infinite excellencies, ſuch incomprehenſible love, ſuch continual mercies, ſhould prevaile with our hearts; and theſe are the three ſpeciall things to procure love, therefore think of theſe, kindle thy love at Gods love, ſee if the love of Chriſt will not conſtraine thee to love him; but this is our miſery, that our hearts ſtand out againſt our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings in ſpiritual things; convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bee they never ſo ſtrong, except God pleaſes to keep open the paſſage betwixt the head and the heart, truths float and lodge in the underſtanding, and ſink not down to the heart; if the heart loves the luſt, though the truths of God take the out-works of the underſtanding, and convince that, yet the heart keeps its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and will not yeeld; like a learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, who being evidently convinc'd, and confeſſing, that hee could not tell what to anſwer, ſaid, notwithſtanding, that his love to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo great, that he would not leave it.</p>

To think God a hard Maſter, to have hard thoughts of him, as if hee would take all advantages againſt us, and that hee delighted in our ſufferings; ſuch are Papiſts, that think God is pleaſed with outward mortifications, as faſtings, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, going bare-foot, wearing hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, &amp;c. as if God delighted in our miſery, and were pleaſed with theſe things, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> to think, that God will bee content with nothing, or that hee will bee content with any thing, are two extremes, the one a blaſphemy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his greatneſs and Majeſty, and the other of his goodneſs, and bowells of compaſſion.

                  <p n="1">1. For if hee gives work, hee gives hands too; if hee layes on a burthen, he gives ſhoulders to bear it, and if thou art weak, hee helps thy infirmities, and if thou art ſick of them, hee cures thy infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. Conſider what the rewards are, how infinitely above all that thy works are worth; nay, that is nothing, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above thy works, but above thy deſires; if thou ſhalt imploy any one in thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, let the journey or buſineſs bee never ſo difficult, if it be in his power; give him but what hee asks hee will do it, though a Porter grone under his burthen, hee would carry it, and if thou giveſt him an hundred pound to carry it croſs the ſtreet, hee will not complain of thee for an hard Maſter, nor of the weight of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, but would bee glad of ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployment; and is God an hard Maſter, who gives ſuch unproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rewards, for ſervices that have ſo little trouble in them; nay,</p>

Do but love, fear, admire, and adore him, and thou canſt not but pleaſe him; and is hee a hard Maſter, who would have thee live in heaven, while thou art on earth? How ſweet are the commands of God?

                  <p n="5">5. God accepts of any thing, If wee do it with a ſincere heart, if wee truly love and believe, though wee have many fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, hee accepts of our perſons, and our ſervices; indeed if wee hate him, there is nothing that we can do can pleaſe him, though wee ſhould do all that were in his heart, as <hi>Jehu</hi> did; but this is not to bee a hard Maſter, for there is none of us but would do ſo, and juſtifie themſelves in their ſo doing; the injuries, that a friend doth imprudently or unwillingly, do not

                  <p>ANother great hinderance, is, not to watch over our thoughts: I confeſs it is the hardeſt, but the profitableſt work a Chriſtian hath to do, the reaſon of the difficulty, is, becauſe the ſame faculty is to watch, and to bee watch'd; when one faculty watcheth another, it is much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, as it is eaſier to watch ones words, than ones thoughts, becauſe they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent operations of the ſoul, as it is eaſier to watch, and take ſuch order, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſhall not make away themſelves, than for one to watch himſelf from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away himſelf, <hi>quis cuſtodiet, ipſus cuſtodes.</hi> Another thing that makes it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult, is, becauſe the thoughts are more unruly, and more ſubject to wander, and being of a ſpiritual nature, it is a hard thing to keep them within compaſs, as it is a hard thing to keep the winde or the light out of a room, becauſe they are ſo
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170460:58"/>ſubtil, and thin, that they enter in at every chink; it is far eaſier to keep out thieves, becauſe the noyſe of breaking open doors gives an alarum and notice to the whole family, but light enters in, <hi>ſine ſtrepitu:</hi> So for words and actions, it is much eaſier to reſtrain them, for whatſoever they do, wee can more eaſier take notice of, they are not ſo ſwift, nor ſo inperceptible in their operations, yet the watching of our thoughts is very profitable, becauſe ſin is ſtopt in its fountain; but the truth of it is, if wee can, it is better to fix the thoughts, than to watch them, as it is far eaſier to impriſon a man, and ſo keep him; than to watch his motions, and it is far leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if one can, to make a woman chaſte, than otherwiſe to keep her from adultery: but the fixing of our thoughts is not to bee done, but by inward mortiſications; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mortifying our love of the world, it is impoſſible to keep our hearts from thinking of it; and therefore if you would fix your thoughts on things that are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, there is no other way, than by ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moring your hearts with ſpiritual things; you muſt ſee the excellency of them, you muſt account them your treaſure, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170460:58"/>then you will be alwayes thinking of them; for ſo our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21. and though Chriſt had not ſaid it, experience teacheth us, that where our treaſure is, there will our hearts bee alſo.</p>

                  <p>ANother great hinderance, is, that we undertake impoſſibilities, <hi>viz.</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God and the world together; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle plainly tells us, <hi>That whoſoever loves the world, and the things of the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2.15.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170460:59"/>trouble; and while one is divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the world and God, one enjoyes neither; one that takes his ſwinge, and wallowes in the pleaſures of the world, without ever looking after Religion, has ſome, though baſe delights; hee that wholly gives himſelf up to enjoy God, hath ten thouſand times more, and better; but he that ſtrives to enjoy both, can have none.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ANother impediment is, to deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, whether it bee ſmaller acts of devotion, or leſſer acts of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The one may bee eaſily avoided, and the other eaſilier performed: What pain or trouble is it to praiſe, and bleſſe, and adore God in thine heart, many times a day? though I am loth to ſet down theſe as leſſer acts of Holineſs. And what great matter of difficulty is there, when thou art about to ſpeak ſome vain or idle word to forbear it, in obedience to God it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to forbear a ſin, than to anſwer for it at the day of Judgement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Smaller acts of ſin, or of holineſs, may more frequently bee performed, and the occaſions of doing them do ofner occur, to ſuffer litterally martyrdome for Chriſts ſake. Bleſſed bee God, in our daies, there hath been none, or rare occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170460:61"/>for it; but to be ſcorn'd, reproach'd, and revil'd. Whoſoever will duely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the rules of Chriſtianity, in carrying himſelf with that meekneſs, poverty of ſpirit, that conſcience and zeal in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſin, that Chriſtianity requires, ſhall have daily occaſion, or moſt, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſolemn duties and Ordinances, partly, becauſe they take up ſo much time, and partly, becauſe they require a total ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration from worldly buſineſſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ejaculatory prayers, occaſional medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and ſuch inward ſhort retirings of the ſoul, take up ſo little time, and may bee mingled with worldly imployments, that they may bee almoſt innumerable every day, and what they want in their magnitude, they may have in number; an Hair is but a ſmall thing, yet becauſe of their multitudes, they keep us very warm: Miſers feaſts, they ſay, uſe to bee very great, but very ſeldome, but in his daily conſtant expences, hee is very fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and omits not the ſmalleſt gain, and it is not ſuch ſeldome extravigances that impoveriſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Smaller duties, and ſmaller ſins, do make way for greater, as the point of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170460:61"/>needle doth for the reſt of it, <hi>nemo repente fit turpiſſimus;</hi> generally wee begin with leſſer ſins, as omiſſions of duties, as friends firſt begin to bee eſtranged, and then they may eaſily become enemies; for frequent committing of leſſer ſins, harden the heart ſo, that that ſin, which if it had been propounded at firſt, would have ſtartled one, yet the heart being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the omiſſions of duties, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the occaſions and temptations of the ſin, they come at laſt from being ſo far from abhorring of it, that they commit it: <hi>Davids</hi> murther of his friend began with his neglect to fight againſt his enemies; and his adultery, began with idleneſs, with ſleeping and gazing, ſo you ſhall ſee by what degrees hee came to commit murther.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee neglects the duty incumbent upon him, at that ſeaſon, and ſo having little to do, hee did nothing, went to ſleep, when hee ſhould have been meditating, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.63. his unſeaſonable ſleep made him unfit for any thing that was good, but fit for any thing that was evil; one act of idleneſs puts him upon another, and both of them fits him for adultery,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170460:62"/>and that ingages him to murther; to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his luſts he commits adultery, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his luſts hee commits murther. Sin is modeſt at firſt; <hi>Solomon</hi> would not build his Wives houſe neer the Temple, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards built an Altar for an Idol, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the ſin bee ſo little, or the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo ſmall, is it not the greater ſin for thee to offend God for ſuch trifles? If the love of God bee not ſtrong enough to perſwade them to do, or abſtain from that which is ſmall, how weak is thy heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Is it not a great ſin in thee, to offend God in ſmall things? It is a great ſin for thee to ſtand out againſt God in ſmall matters.</p>

                  <p>THe next great impediment is, the not conſidering the ſinfulneſſe, and the miſchief that ſins of omiſſion do us; few there are but make conſcience of ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their neighbour, but make not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enough of preſerving his good name, more make conſcience of ſinful words, than of ſinful ſilence, more make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of doing evil, than of doing nothing; therefore that you may bee more ſenſible of the ſinfulneſs and ſins of omiſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the greateſt ſins in the world, except the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, are ſins of omiſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> ignorance, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, impenitency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That at the day of Judgement, the ſins that Chriſt ſhall condemn wicked men for, are ſins of omiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thy ſins of omiſſion are far more than thy ſins of commiſſion, for every ſin of commiſſion includes in it ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170460:63"/>not è <hi>contra.</hi> Conſider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many precious thoughts of God thou mighteſt have had the laſt hour, which thou hadſt not, and ſo many thoughts not had, ſo many ſins of omiſſion; nay, every holy duty, has more ſins of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than it hath goodneſs of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, for there are three kindes of ſins of omiſſion, one in omitting the duty it ſelf, the other in omitting <hi>debitas circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantias,</hi> and the third, in omitting <hi>debitos gradus:</hi> So that though you do perform the duty, either you omit doing it for that end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo want ſincerity, or elſe do it not with ſuch a high degree of love, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>The next impediment, is, not to come fully off for God.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe eleventh great impediment, is, that wee do not come off fully and wholly for God, wee would fain have both the World and God, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee; it is impoſſible to have ones
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170460:63"/>treaſures in heaven, and in earth too: This halting betwixt two opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and <hi>Baal,</hi> and ſerving two Maſters, God and <hi>Mammon,</hi> is that which hinders us from doing either effectually; for while wee are thinking, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to enjoy the world, the thoughts of heaven make us, that wee cannot free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy that; and when wee are about to ſerve God, the thoughts of the world take us off from him; great miſchiefes come by our thus having an heart for God, and an heart for the world; and the truth of it is;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is impoſſible, as it is impoſſible for any body to have two centers, either of magnitude or weight; ſo it is for the ſoul to have two centers, God and the world; for as the firſt cauſe of all things can bee but one, ſo the laſt end of all our deſires and endeavours, can bee but one ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate end, wee may have many, but not co-ordinate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence comes all our miſchiefes, all our troubles and diſtractions come from hence: For as it is in a Kingdome, when it is divided, and there are two which would ſtrive for ſoveraignty, there muſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170460:64"/>needs bee continually civil wars; ſo that ſoul can have no peace, but muſt bee in continual war and diſquiet, when the world and God ſtrive who ſhall rule. From whence come wars and fightings within you? Come they not hence, of your luſts that war in your members? 'tis our luſtings after the world, that make all our inward perturbations in our ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This makes us, that wee cannot run the Race that is ſet before us, as not with joy, as already hath been ſaid, ſo not with ſpeed; juſt as one that halts, runs neither with that ſpeed, nor eaſe, nor comelineſs: So hee that halts betwixt God, and any thing elſe, goes but ſlowly on in the waves of God; therefore if God bee God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, if the world bee God, follow that: Hee that is going from <hi>Sodom,</hi> and looks back, muſt needs make many a ſtop in his journey.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Take heed, for thy hearkening after the world though for the preſent, it may bee, they onely hinder thee in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet it will come to paſs at laſt, that they will hinder thee from Gods ſervice, thy ſinning and praying will not laſt long,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170460:64"/>for either thy ſin will make thee leave off praying, or thy praying will make thee leave off ſinning: So thy love of the world will either make thee leave off lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God, or the loving of God will make thee leave off loving the world; For God will ſo order it by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that thou ſhalt bee forc'd to chuſe one; as it befell the young man, that would needs know what hee muſt do to bee ſaved, hee thought hee might love riches, and follow Chriſt, but it would not bee.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thou muſt never think to have any great meaſure of communion with God, as long as thou ſtandeſt in this uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and irreſoluteneſs; As a woman, as long as ſhee is courted by two, and will not give an abſolute denial to one of them, cannot enjoy either as an husband, &amp;c. &amp; ſo wants that communion that ſhe might have with the one, ſo that indeed both viſit her, but ſhee dwells with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So while thou art thus doubting and wavering, thou may'ſt have many viſits and motions of the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of God does not dwell in thee; thou looſeſt thoſe unſpeakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170460:65"/>both of grace and joy, which come by the co-habitation of the Spirit; therefore make Religion thy buſineſſe, and follow God fully, as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> did, and follow hard after God, as <hi>David</hi> did, and preſs forward to the mark, as <hi>Paul did,</hi> and ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, as our Saviour commands.</p>

                  <p>THe twelfth great impediment, is, worldly company, ſuch as have no acquaintance with God, but talk of ſuch things, as Turks and Heathens do talk of as well as they: When a Saint has been in private raviſht with the love of God, and the joyes of heaven, and meets with company which ſpeaks not one word of ſuch matters, nor can, what a damp is it, and quenching, as it were, of the ſpirit of God in us? How ſapleſs, juiceleſs, and without reliſh are ſuch diſcourſes? And the people of God do generally looſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170460:65"/>more by worldly men, that in reſpect of their converſation are ſomewhat blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, than they looſe by wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men, for their company they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly avoid, but the other, they converſing withal, they ſuffer much from. It is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in every ones mouth, that wee have three grand enemies the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, but few there are that deal with the fleſh, or with the world, as enemies, but they endeavour too much to pleaſe both, which they do not uſe to do to enemies; nay, wee ſuffer very much many wayes, meerly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe wee would not diſpleaſe the men of the world. I knew an excellent Chriſtian, a woman of Quality, who ſpent moſt of her time in private and ſecret duties, a woman of the greateſt eminency, for that, as I knew: She, when perſons of great Quality came to ſee her, would not omit her ſet times, but would, as they call'd rudely, take her leave of them, rather than omit her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. Alas, What good can conferences with the people of the world do us? though they talk of the things of God, their diſcourſes are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and unſavoury; for one may
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170460:66"/>ſee, that they ſpeak of things they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, and have no experience of; they ſpeak, as if one ſhould ſpeak of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> that was never there. Alas, they are neither able to comfort one, nor to adviſe one, concerning ſpiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the leſſe wee have to do with them, the better.</p>

                  <p>The next impediment, is, abundance of worldly imployments and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Many there are, that never think they can exceed this way, and they put it all under the notion of their particular calling, and graſp ſo much buſineſs, that they can have no leiſure or communion with God; nay, that time which they do ſpend in private, their heads and hearts are ſo diſtracted with the thoughts of their imployments, that God has little of them, but their bodily preſence, and lip-labour; for what with the buſineſs they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170460:66"/>in before duty, and that which they are to bee imployed in as ſoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they have done, there is ſuch a throng of worldly thoughts in their heads, and hearts, that they do finde it an hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to get their hearts ſo much as in tune, the time is ſo little they can ſpare for ſuch matters; then all muſt bee excuſed, they muſt provide for their families, or elſe they are worſe than Infidels; whereas they ſhould withal, think of providing for their own ſouls, and for the ſoules of their families; and their prayers with them, for them, and inſtructions of them; they do not conſider enough, how that Chriſt blames <hi>Martha</hi> for being buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout many things, though they were not onely domeſtical imployments, but ſuch as belonged to her, and were undertaken for the immediate ſervice and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt; and if Chriſt blamed the multitude of her imployments thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, how much more will hee blame theirs? They ſhould alſo conſider, that thoſe children thrive beſt, for the moſt part, both in the matters of the world, and eſpecially in the matters of God, who have ſo much left them, as they may,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170460:67"/>with their own reaſonable endeavours and induſtry, live well, elſe not. And theſe men, if they can but finde a place of Scripture or two, which injoynes them to take up ſome calling or other, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and quiet themſelves, as if their greedy and covetous deſires were juſtified by it. Why do they not alſo conſider, how earneſt the Scripture is in ſetting down the danger, and deceitfulneſs, and uncertainty of riches, inſomuch, wee ſcarce read of any rich man that was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except hee were holy firſt? And thoſe that wee read of that were holy, they got their riches not by ſuch worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as now adayes are uſed, but ſuch, wherein they had abundance of leiſure to ſerve God, for they were generally Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and their riches conſiſted in cattel. So <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Job, David,</hi> they ſhould alſo think with themſelves, how much the Scripture preſſeth us to have our converſation in heaven, and there to lay up our treaſures, and that we ſhould bee frequent in prayer, meditation, and cloſet duties, for without frequency in them, 'tis impoſſible to bee heavenly minded in earthly imployments: Hee
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170460:67"/>needs frequently to take Antidotes, that converſes, nay, lives with thoſe that have the plague. Why do not men put bounds to their deſires of growing rich? they put bounds to their charity, and to their times for ſolemn duties, and why not to the things of the world?</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170460:68"/>ſomewhat, inſomuch, that it is a hard thing to pray as wee ought, upon a full ſtomack, without being ſick: And if one has ſomething that wee muſt obtain of God, and intend to wraſtle with him for it, wee ſhall finde that our very bodies will receive alterations in the combate: If ſo bee Religion bee ſuch an eaſie thing, as ſome lazy perſons will make it, let them anſwer mee theſe few Queries.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Why does the Scripture ſpeak o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of it? Why does Chriſt ſay, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many ſhall ſeek to enter in, but they ſhall not bee able?</hi> if wee may bee lazy in this work, Why are wee commanded to ſtir up the grace of God that is in us, 2 <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> 1.6. Why doth God by his Prophet complain, that no man ſtirs himſelf up? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.7. Why does the Scripture ſpeak of following hard after God, and of our life, as a continual war-fare?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How comes it to paſs, that moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Saints have found ſo much ado? Do wee not read how <hi>Jacob</hi> wraſtled all night with teares and ſupplications? <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12.4. How did that bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> fight? not as one beating the ayr. How
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170460:68"/>did hee preſſe forwards towards the mark, forgetting the things that were behinde, and beat down, and keep in ſubjection his body? How hee was in faſtings often in perils by Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> paſſed thorough good report, and ill report; and how comes it to paſs that thou thwarting one corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or denying thy ſelf in any thing, thou giveſt thy fleſh what eaſe, what diet, what pleaſure ſoever it deſires? If it bee but a little cold, rather than thou wilt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, thou wilt leave Ordinances, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as much Religion as may ſtand with the praiſe of men, the eaſe of thy body, the ſaving, nay, the increaſing of thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, if that will ſave thy ſoul. O how far art thou from leaving, hating Father, and Mother, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, thine own life, for his ſake. Flatter not thy ſelf, if thou wilt not croſs a luſt, nor leave a ſin in the time of peace, thou wilt not leave thy life in time of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for his Namesſake.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Why does the Scripture ſay, that the righteous ſhall ſcarcely bee ſaved? And bee thou ſure, that if ever thou comeſt to heaven, thou ſhalt wonder how it was poſſible, but that then thou ſhalt ſee the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170460:69"/>infinite wiſdome and power of God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering things, how it was poſſible that thou ſhouldeſt eſcape ſuch imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: Thou wilt ſee that thouſands of times in thy life (what with thy back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, thy groſs careleſneſs of duties, and in duties, by the victories that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have gotten of thee) that thou haſt been at the very brink of the pit of hell, and that there has been but an haires breadth betwixt thee and deſtruction: Alas, the ſenſleſneſſe of thy dangers, temptations, corruptions, makes thee ſo careleſs, and ſo little to wonder at thy ſafety: like him, that in a dark night rid over a very narrow long plank, that was laid over a great bridge that was repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they who knew the danger, ask'd him, how hee came into the City that way? Hee ſaid, why, what ſhould ail him, hee came, and rid over the bridge? But the next day, when hee ſaw the danger hee had eſcaped, the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the danger, though paſt, made him fall down for dead. Surely if thou comeſt to heaven with lazy wiſhes, and performances, it muſt bee by ſome other way than ever the Word of God hath
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170460:69"/>ſpoken of? it muſt bee by ſome Goſpel that <hi>Paul</hi> never preach'd; nay, ſuch an one, that if hee, or an Angel from heaven ſhould preach, they ſhould be accurſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Go and enquire of all the Saints of God, of the moſt experienced Chriſtians, and ask them that have twenty, thirty, ſixty yeares experience of the wayes of God, and power of godlineſſe, and they will tell thee, that though Religion, and keeping of ſtrict communion with God, has more delight in it than the world can know, and ſuch, that if they had ten thouſand worlds, they would give all to enjoy him whom their ſoul loves? yet they will tell you alſo, that it has coſt them many a fervent prayer, many a ſtrong cry, many a doubtful conflict, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears, ſighs, and groanes; nay, they will tell you, that they have ſo ſtrange and ſtrong temptations ſtill to grapple withal, and that not any corruption is ſo fully vanquiſh'd, but that it ſometimes troubles ſtill; and that as long as they have an heart ſo full of corruptions, and live in a world ſo full of temptations; and Satan is ſo full of malice, they do not, nor can expect to put off their armour,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170460:70"/>and think to ſleep upon a bed of Roſes: generally, 'tis peoples ignorance, and want of experience, that makes them have ſuch light, and ſlight thoughts of the great buſineſſe of Religion. Indeed, if they think it eaſie, from their ſenſe and conference, in the power of God, that's ſomething: Men generally in the matters of Religion, do as preſumptuous perſons do in their confidence of the pardon of their ſins; they think ſin diſpleaſes God no more than themſelves; and from their ſenſleſneſſe of the ſinfulneſſe, greatneſſe, and number of their ſins, proceeds their eaſineſſe of their carnal belief of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them: So from their ſenſſeſneſſe and ignorance of the greatneſſe of the work, and labour of love, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and impetuouſneſſe of their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and Satans temptations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds their carnal confidence of their eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to bee ſaved. Is it ſo then, that the eſtabliſhed Decrees of God, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all Saints ſhews, that the way to heaven is up hill, it is not to bee attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without fightings without, and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings within; and muſt thou have a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way made for thee only to go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170460:70"/>in? muſt the Rock of God his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees bee removed, and the experience of all the Saints on the earth be altered for thee? <hi>Job</hi> 18.4. May wee not ſay in this caſe, as it is in the matter of poverty, that which makes one live contentedly, is, that ones minde, and ones eſtate agree? Wee generally deſire that God would bring our eſtates to our mindes, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, that wee ſhould bring our mindes to our eſtates, as to our content, it is all one which of theſe two are done; and is it not much more reaſon, that wee ſhould yeeld to the deſires of God, than that hee ſhould yeeld to ours? So in this caſe: Is it not much more reaſon that we ſhould make the work of Religion eaſier and eaſier, by multiplying holy duties, (for the more wee pray, the eaſier and the better wee pray) than that God ſhould make it eaſier, by abating our work? For as in the other inſtance, if God ſhould give us according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in earthly things, there would bee no end, for that which wee deſire to day, would as little ſatisfie us to morrow, as that which wee deſired yeſterday, doth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us to day; ſo if that our duty ſhould
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170460:71"/>bee abated, there would bee no end, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God would bee ſatisfied that wee ſhould do nothing at all in his ſervice; for hee that is unwilling to pray thrice a day, will bee more unwilling to pray twice within a little while, and after that once. But you will ſay, it may bee, we would not have our work abated, but our ſtrength encreaſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Art thou indeed in carneſt? Doſt thou not deſire ſtrength, as <hi>Pilate</hi> asked, <hi>what was truth,</hi> and doeſt neither care, nor ſtay for an anſwer? Then, I ſay, who hinders thee? I am ſure, God hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thee not, nay, bee commands thee to ask grace, and ſtrength of him, and hath promiſed to give it: <hi>If any man lack wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let him ask it from above,</hi> Jam. 1.5. <hi>Ask, and you ſhall have,</hi> Mat. 7 7. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed of this great errour, to think, that Ordinances careleſly enjoyed, duties lazily performed, corruptions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, temptations unrefiſted, a mouth full of formal prayers, and a heart full of cold deſires, will bring thee to heaven: If once thou comeſt to have a carnall thought of the eaſineſſe of the wayes of God, and thinkeſt that a little is too much,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170460:71"/>thou wilt quickly come to think, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all is enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, Doth not Chriſt himſelf ſay, that <hi>his yoke is eaſie, and his burthen light?</hi> Why do you then make it ſuch a difficult thing to bee reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for that is as great a hinderance and diſcouragement, and enough to fright any one from Religion?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, therefore, in ſeveral propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That though the ſervice of God bee difficult, yet it is not impoſſible, for <hi>(de facto)</hi> many have ſerved God, ſo as hee hath accepted and rewarded them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not only poſſible, but certain, that wee ſhall ſerve God acceptably, if it bee not our own faults, if wee are not wanting to God, and to our ſelves, wee cannot miſcarry; every ſervant that ſhall bee condemned for ſin, ſhall bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ſlothfulneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.26.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is impoſſible for him that will continue fighting, to bee overcome; if wee will not put off our armour, and caſt away our weapons, let the daies bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo evil, wee ſhall ſtand, and when all is done that our enemies can do, wee ſhall ſtand, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13.</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:170460:72"/>
                  <p n="4">4. The promiſes are not made to thoſe that attain to perfection, but that aim at perfection; for the Apoſtle himſelf had not attained perfection, but followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. So the promiſe is not made to him that hath overcome, but that doth overcome, or is overcoming. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17. and it is not ſaid perfect love hath caſt out fear, it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. How difficult ſoever Religion is, in this reſpect, it is eaſie, that it is above the ſtrength of none of Gods people. In this caſe it is as it was with <hi>Manna,</hi> hee that hath much, hath nothing over, hee that hath little, hath no want; in temporals, that burthen that requireth the ſtrength of a Giant, cannot bee carried by an Infant; but the ſervice of God, though it cannot bee performed acceptably, unleſs hee doth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, uſe his utmoſt ſtrength; yet a new born babe may do it, for hee requires but thy (all) let that all bee never ſo little, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. for if thy ſtrength bee little, God will keep thee from temptations, as hee promiſeth, ver. 10.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. How difficult and uneaſie ſoever the yoke of Chriſt is, it is eaſier than the law,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170460:72"/>for that requireth not only endeavours, but performance, not that the Copy that wee are to write by, is leſſe exact, than that of the Law, for the Law it ſelf remaines in its perfection as a rule; but now, though wee write with blots, miſtakes, and not exactly to the Copy, it is accepted, and ſincere endeavours, and not exact performance, is required.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As the yoke and burthen of Chriſt is eaſier than that of the Law, ſo it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier than that of ſin, for it is a recreation to that; for Chriſt ſaith, hee will refreſh us, by changing the yoke of ſin for that of the Goſpel; ſo that you muſt not think to mend your ſelves, by caſting off Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for that of ſin is far heavier, as in many inſtances will evidently appeare, what burthens do ſinful pleaſures bring along with them? drunkenneſs, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, luſt; how many diſeaſes do they bring upon us? How is head, and heart, and purſe, and all imployed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but it is neither labour nor coſt to forgive injuries, ſo to cark and care, what diſtractions it brings upon one, but if wee do caſt our care upon God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our wants known by prayer and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170460:73"/>ſupplication, <hi>then the Peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding, will keep our hearts and mindes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. How hard ſoever the ſervice of God is, how heavy ſoever his burthen, and though your whole ſtrength bee required, yet you ſhall never bee weary in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if you will but ſet to your ſtrength; indeed if you do not put to your ſtrength, then you may bee weary, but elſe, inſtead of looſing, you ſhall encreaſe your ſtrength, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31. if you will run, you ſhall fly; if you will run, you ſhall not bee weary; if you cannot run, if you will walk as faſt as you can, you ſhall not faint.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Though the ſervice of God bee dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and impoſſible to corrupt nature, yet it is not only poſſible, but delightful to the regenerate man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1.2. So that though as muſick it may bee hard to bee practiſed, yet it is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Though the buſineſſe of Religion bee a thing impoſſible to us, if wee look upon our own ſtrength only, nay, though wee are regenerate, though wee have the will, yet wee cannot have the deed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170460:73"/>further aſſiſtance and influence, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. nay, though wee delight in the wayes of God, yet wee cannot walk in them, without his inabling of us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.35. yet conſidering the abundance of means, and helps, that wee have from Chriſt, the burthen is light, and the yoke caſie; that which the ſtrength of no man can move, a childe may move with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ONe great impediment, whereby wee are hindered in the wayes of God, is this, becauſe wee cannot do ſo much as wee ſhould and would, therefore wee do not what wee can, whereas wee ſhould do to the uttermoſt of our power, though wee cannot do ſo much as wee deſire to do; I ſhall inſtance in the matter of Thankſgiving, and Praiſe, as thus, when wee conſider with our ſelves what ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

Now I ſhall ſet down what wee ought to do in ſuch a caſe, as to the matter of praiſe and thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In caſe thou canſt not finde ſpiritual mercies to bleſſe God for, bleſſe him for temporals, thine health, thine eſtare, that thy body is not full of boiles, that thy houſe was not on fire about thee in the night, that it falls not upon thee and thy children in the day; doſt thou not know, that this is from the good providence of God? doſt thou not know that Satan is a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure? Do you think the devil is ſo kinde to thee, or any one, that hee ſpares thee out of love? or do you think that he wants power to caſt down thy houſe, or ſmite thee with boils, or bring down fire from heaven? hee did theſe things to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170460:74"/>
                     <hi>Job,</hi> and who is that that reſtrains him? Haſt thou any iron chains that can hold this roaring Lion? What weapons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive or defenſive againſt this enemy? Well, then bleſs God for thoſe temporal bleſſings which thou haſt, for it is evident, that it is not thou that makeſt an hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thy ſelfe, and all that thou haſt, but God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou canſt finde no poſitive ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mercies to bleſs God for, then bleſs him for thoſe that are privative or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; as for example, Canſt thou not ſee any evident cauſe to bleſs God, for giving thee grace, yet bleſs God for keeping thee from ſuch and ſuch ſins, in this ſenſe thou mayeſt humbly bleſs God, that thou art no adulterer, no murtherer, no blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as to the outward acts of them; let not God looſe the praiſe that is due to him, for his preſerving of thee from ſuch abominations, and let thy heart bee much affected, and highly prize theſe ſpiritual preſervations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If thou canſt not find any diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual mercies, then bleſs him for common ſpiritual mercies: If thou canſt not finde any ſuch mercies, that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170460:75"/>thee from Reprobates, bleſs God for thoſe that diſtinguiſh thee from <hi>Turks, Jewes, Heathens,</hi> viz. that thou haſt been born and brought up where the Goſpel is profeſt, purely, ſpiritually, frequently preached.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you can finde no grace in your ſelf, yet bleſs God for the graces of others: Do you not finde your heart ſometimes inlarged with joy and thankfulneſs, when you hear of ſuch or ſuch an eminent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, for the grace that God hath given them? And if you can finde your hearts affected with Gods preſerving of you from ſin, and with the light of the Goſpel, and with the graces of others, bee of good comfort, it is a ſingular ſign of grace in thy ſelf: For I may ſay, as <hi>Epictetus</hi> did in ſomewhat the like caſe, <hi>Others are ſick, ſo am I, others are poor, ſo am I, but I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly:</hi> His ſickneſs, nor poverty, did not diſtinguiſh him from others, but his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſubmiſſion did: So others that are wicked men, God preſerves them from many ſins, gives them to live in the light of his Goſpel, and they ſee and know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are holy, but they do not bleſſe God for theſe things, nor prize them

                  <p n="5">5. In caſe you ſhould not finde any thing, or not bee affected with any thing that hee hath done for you, as in ſome ſad times of deſertion it may come to paſs, partly from their great undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things that are nor diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercies, as alſo from their ignorance, that any ſuch mercies belong to them; yet in ſuch caſes wee muſt remember, that we muſt give the Lord that glory that is due to his name, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 29.2. &amp; 96.8. If thou canſt finde nothing to bleſs God for, wherein hee hath been good to thee, bleſs him for his own Excellencies, for that goodneſs which hee hath, and is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: If thou canſt not bleſs him for the new name that hee hath given to thee: If thou canſt not bleſs him for thy name, yet give him the glory due to his name: If thou canſt not bleſs him for his promiſes, becauſe thou thinkeſt they do not belong to thee, yet bleſs him for his Attributes and Excellencies, and give him that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that thou knoweſt belongs to him; for by thy admiring and adoring God for his own Excellencies, thy heart will bee brought in frame, and diſpoſed for the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170460:76"/>manifeſtations of his love to thee. Now I will help you a little in this matter, ſhewing you how you may act the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and adorings of God, in thoſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of Eternity, Power, Wiſdome, Goodneſs; for as for his truth, as long as thou canſt not perceive thy intereſt in any promiſe (the faithfulneſs of God being a meer relative Attribute) it will little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thee.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Think with thy ſelf, and ſay, from everlaſting to everlaſting, thou art God; think of his eternity, and thou ſhalt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde that it is ſuch an Ocean, that thou canſt neither fathom, or ſee the ſhore of it, for the thoughts of Eternity are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelming thoughts; and when thou findeſt that thy thoughts are at a loſs, and that God dwells in thick darkneſs, then cry out, and ſay, <hi>Lord manifeſt thy ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us;</hi> for as long as thy thoughts are able to maſter their work, when their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is God, they are neither worthy of him, nor able to affect thee, until they come to bee loſt in admiration, in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and adorings of God, they are little better than Idolatry; for thou thinkeſt of God, as of a creature.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:170460:76"/>
                  <p n="2">2. For the power of God, conſider that ſtanding miracle, in ſetting the Sands as bounds to the Sea, that though the waters thereof lie on heaps, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe tempeſts and ſtormes that make the Sea rage, yet the Sand is a rope which can binde it; nothing ſets bounds to the Sea further: If you conſider how that the devils, notwithſtanding their number, and their ſtrength, cannot do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing without his leave, their malice, certainly, againſt God is ſo great, that they would not do any thing that God would have them to do, if they could tell how to help it. Further, if wee conſider how that all things were made by God of nothing, without the leaſt labour, or help, or inſtruments, to think that all that God did to create light, was his ſaying, <hi>Let there bee light;</hi> that all things ſhould obey him, is not comparably ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as that nothing it ſelf ſhould obey him, and that hee ſhould call and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thoſe things that are not, as if they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. Well might the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens ſay, That all the praiſe and high expreſſions that all the Poets uſed in the praiſe of their gods, came not neer that

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Wiſdome of God, conſider how infinite it was, by theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God ſhould make this world conſiſting of ſuch innumerable variety of creatures, and they of ſo many parts; as for example, mans body, of how many parts, bones, veins, nerves, ſinews, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. ſo wee may ſay of all birds, fiſhes, beaſts, trees, &amp;c. Now for God to make all theſe without any pattern at firſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſulting, as wee conſult; for the firſt thoughts that ever God had for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving the world, were his laſt; for God did not at firſt think of creating the world ſo and ſo, and afterward, upon ſecond thoughts, found out a better way. I ſay, for God to make all theſe things ſo exact, that the wiſdome of the creature cannot bring the works of God to perfection, nor the wiſdome of God himſelf mend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that hee hath done, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde out any defect in the works of Creation, no, not in the leaſt circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, theſe things are incomprehenſible.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Concerning the mercy, patience, and long-ſuffering, &amp;c. of God. What can bee ſpoken or thought worthy of them? It is true, that the Attributes of God in him, or although the Attributes of God in themſelves, are infinite, yet as to their manifeſtations to us, the mercies of God are above all his works: This is that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute that makes all the reſt of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes amiable, takes off the terrour of his juſtice, the carnal dread of his Majeſty, inſomuch, that the very conſideration of his goodneſs, if we would be but ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, clearly, and fully ſatisfied of it, would make us go with more humble confidence to God, in every of our ſtreights, than we do to the neereſt, deareſt friend that wee had in the world, of whoſe love we have had the moſt conſtant, familiar, longeſt experience: Wee diſhonour God, to go
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170460:78"/>before him with carnal trembling: The Emperour was angry with him that gave him a petition with a trembling hand: What do you give mee a Petition, ſaith hee, as if you were to give meat to an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant? if any thing under heaven will make a friend forſake one, it is ones hard and miſtruſtful thoughts of him: Do not think of God, as of a Lion, that will tear you in pieces, no, not though thou art a grievous ſinner; for if thou wilt not fly from him, nor come againſt him, but come unto him; if thou comeſt weary, though as yet thou art heavy laden with thy ſins, though thou art not yet rid of them, yet if they are thy burthen, that thou deſireſt God would take off from thee, hee will not refuſe thee, hee hath invited thee, and doubtleſs thou ſhalt bee welcome if thou comeſt: Canſt thou plead no intereſt in Gods promiſes? Canſt thou not plead his Attributes? Thou art not ſo qualified, as thou thinkeſt, as to challenge God upon his promiſes; yet, if with reverence it may bee ſpoken, God is qualified with ſo much ſweetneſs, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and long-ſuffering, &amp;c. that hee will in no wiſe refuſe thee, if thou comeſt to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170460:79"/>him; nay, the truth of it is, hee is inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by promiſe, and by oath, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 6.17.</p>
                  <p>Now in theſe meditations, concerning the Attributes of God, if in your medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you do not attain to any clear and affecting apprehenſions of him, ſay unto him, <hi>Lord manifeſt thy ſelf unto mee, the vail it is rent, and I cannot ſee within the vail:</hi> And if thou haſt clear and affecting apprehenſions of him, than neglect not to beg of him clearer manifeſtations and diſcoveries of himſelf: For when thou canſt look upon him that is inviſible with the eye of Faith, and ſpeak to him, as a friend ſpeaks to a friend, thy prayers will bee very effectual; and know this, that the knowledge of God is the <hi>primum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning the giving of God the glory of his Name, and praiſing of him for his own Excellencies, I ſhall give you three examples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.21. it is, as if you ſhould ſay, Let God do what hee pleaſes with me, though he ſhould ſtrip me as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as ever I was born, or as I ſhall be when I die, though I had not one mercy left to praiſe him for, yet I have his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170460:79"/>left to praiſe him for; ſo it is with thoſe that are in deſertion, though they neither have, as they think, any mercies, but ſuch as are ſnares, and they ſhall pay dearly for; and though they look upon God as an enemy, yet they are loath hee ſhould bee diſhonoured, they would have him have the glory of his Name.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.5. When they were in great diſtreſs, upon a day of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they think it fit to begin with giving God the praiſe due to his Name, and would not have him ſtay for that, till he beſtow'd new mercies upon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Revelations</hi> 4.11. This is the very practiſe of thoſe in heaven, and it is an heavenly practiſe to bleſs God more for his own Excellencies, and to praiſe him more, that hee hath created all things for himſelf, than for us: And herein appears their excellency of their love to God, that though they enjoy ſuch wonderful and incomprehenſible bleſſings from him, yet they are more affected with, and bleſſe God for the glory hee hath, than the happineſs that they have from them. We read but of one example to this, and that is of our bleſſed Saviour, who gave God
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170460:80"/>the glory of his love, even in the midſt of his agony: Father, if it bee poſſible, hee gave him the glory and title of a Father, even then, when hee was uſing him as an enemy; and it is a higher act of Holineſs, to give God the glory of his Love, while hee is ſcourging of thee with Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than to give God the honour of his Excellencies, when hee is crowning us with glory. There are two kindes of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes that the people of God do uſe, when they pray to God, either ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, as are moſt for the ſtrengthening of their Faith, for the obtaining of that which they pray for, or ſuch, as may, as it were, vindicate God from thoſe aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that his providences ſeem to caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Sometimes they ſerve for both, as <hi>Revelations</hi> 6.10. The Holineſs, and the truth of God, ſerve to ſtrengthen their Faith, in believing that God would deliver his people from their perſecution; for hee was ingaged, in point of Holineſs, not to proſper the wicked againſt the Saints; and in point of truth, to perform his threatnings againſt the wicked; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou canſt not, becauſe thou want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the ſenſe of it, praiſe God for his love,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170460:80"/>yet praiſe him for his lovelineſs: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hee ſhould do nothing for thee, muſt not hee have the praiſe that is due to his Name? Suppoſe ſome learned, wiſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, ſhould, ſeeing a Toad crawling in his bed-chamber, cauſe it to bee put out of doors, but would not have it killed? ſhould hee looſe the glory of all his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the love and praiſe due to his holineſs, becauſe hee would not ſuffer the Toad to continue ſtill in his Chamber? nay, rather, was not his meekneſs to bee wondred at, that hee ſhould forbid the deſtruction of ſuch a creature, or have any regard what became of it? So, though God ſhould never ſuffer thee to ſee his face, that art more odious, in reſpect of ſin, to God. than a Toad can bee to us, ſhall God therefore want the glory of his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, becauſe hee takes no more care of ſuch an inconſiderable thing as thou art. With this ſaying I ſhall conclude, That the very damned, in the midſt of their torments, though God bee powring forth the vials of his wrath upon them, yet they ought to give God the glory of his Excellencies, and they do ill to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him.</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:170460:81"/>
                  <p>So it is alſo in the matter of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though thou canſt not finde thy heart affected with the ſinfulneſs of ſin, therefore thou thinkeſt vain for thee to confeſſe thy ſins; but it is not vain, for thou muſt confeſs thy ſinnes, that thou mayeſt bee ſenſible of them; and though thou canſt not confeſs with ſenſe of ſin, confeſs without it: But this caution is to bee obſerved, leſt I bee miſtaken; When I wiſh thee to confeſs ſin, though thou haſt no ſenſe of ſin, I wiſh thee to uſe ſuch confeſſion, as a meanes not to reſt there, and this is not to do as wicked men do, for they do outward actions and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not as a meanes and a help to do more, for they do not deſire to do more; but whoſoever uſeth this as a meanes to attain to higher performances, do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that which God requires, and accepts; for hee that ſaith, Lord, here are my two mites, though I owe ten thouſand talents, and though this be far from being all that I owe, yet it is all that I have, and God will accept, according to what wee have, and not according to what we have not.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ANother impediment is, that wee are not convinced of, and affected with the vanities of the world: Of things that are ſeen, God hath done abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſatisfie us. There are two things, of which it hath pleaſed the Spirit of God to write two whole books, that we might bee ſatisfied; <hi>viz.</hi> the vanity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the love of Chriſt; And what Argument almoſt can bee greater, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the difficulty and neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving theſe truths, than this, that the Spirit of God hath been ſo induſtrious, if I may ſo ſay, in clearing theſe two truths? Surely all the wayes whereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing can bee made manifeſt to us, theſe truths are made out, all things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the trial of the ſenſes, wee evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern the vanity of them, for the eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing; and for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſes, 'tis evident, their delights are
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170460:82"/>more bruitiſh, but not more ſatisfactory; and 2. reaſon doth abundantly convince us, that riches, which is the golden Image that Satan hath ſet up, and all Tongues, Languages, and Nations, fall down, and worſhip. I ſay, as for the inſufficiency of riches, the very Phyloſophers, as <hi>Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Seneca, Ariſtotle, &amp;c.</hi> have ſeen by the light of reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for experience, as far as ever our own went, wee cannot but ſet our ſeal to it, whether it bee pleaſure, profit, or honour, wee muſt needs ſet our ſeal to it, that all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit: How often do wee nauſeate thoſe things, when wee have them, which wee impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſir'd, until we had them: And 4. for the experience of others, ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, to this day, it hath not been heard of any, whoſe deſires have been ſatisfied with the creature; and 5. as for the Word of God, that is ſo clear, that they that run may read it. But is not this wonderful, that notwithſtanding ſenſe, reaſon, experience, faith ſhow us ſo clearly the truth of it, yet not one of an hundred of thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians, live as men convinc'd of this truth, but
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170460:82"/>their whole love, joy, delight, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, are plac'd upon, and run out after theſe things; and yet whenſoever they read in any book, or hear in any Sermon, a diſcourſe concerning this matter, they think it to bee a moral diſcourſe, much below them; but they ſhould know, that whatſoever truth they have not practiſed, is rather above them. Let no man, nor your own heart deceive you with vain words, it is as much ſenſe to ſay, there goes a godly Drunkard, there goes a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Harlot, as to ſay, there goes a godly covetous man: And bee not deceived, one may as truly ſay, ſuch a man drinks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, while his tongue faulters, his feet reel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but hee is no drunkard; ſuch a man never ſpeaks as hee thinks, nor doth as hee ſpeaks, and yet hee is a true <hi>Nathanael,</hi> an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> in whom there is no guile; as truly you may ſay all this, as to ſay, ſuch a man hath a great eſtate, and yet is as earneſt to get more, as if hee had not to buy bread, gives not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of his incomes to the poor, nor of his time to God; ſuch a man will ride many ſcore of miles to a Fair, but will not go croſs the ſtreet to a Sermon; hee
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170460:83"/>will talk with a great deal of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the things of the world, but either is ſilent, or ſpeaks ignorantly of the things of God, but yet hee is not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous.</p>
                  <p>Though the ſubſtance of this Chapter been neer of Kin to ſomething that hath been ſpoken before, yet the love of the world is ſuch an Epidemical evil, that though it bee ſome labour, yet, I hope, it will not bee loſt, I think fit to inculcate the ſame again, and again.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I ſhall now come to the means and helps of a godly life; but as it is in recovering of health, food nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, unleſſe the peccant humours bee removed by Phyſick; ſo unleſſe theſe impediments bee taken away, the following meanes will not profit; if wee love the impediments more than the things they keep us from, as if wee love a multitude of worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, more than grace: How juſtly may God give us up to our owne hearts deſires?

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt thing that is neceſſary to an holy life, is Faith; for without that, 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God; 'tis the foundation of things hoped for, and the foundation of our love. I have many times ſeriouſly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170460:85"/>thought, what is the true reaſon why ſo few believe the Scripture, aſſuring my ſelf, that if they did firmly believe, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that their lives ſhould bee ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: For although, as I have ſaid, conviction does not neceſſarily work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, yet it would work reformation, or at leaſt, it would not ſuffer them to go on, with ſo little fear and dread upon their ſpirits, as they do. Now, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pretend, that it is, becauſe divers ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative truths, that are ſet down in the Scripture, are ſo contrary to, or at leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their reaſon, that they cannot aſſent to them; yet I am very confident, that it is the practical truths of the Scripture that they ſtop at, which they being loth to obey, they are fain to pretend, or by the juſt judgment of God, they are diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to believe thoſe truths that are more ſpeculative; that this is the reaſon, ſeems to me evident, becauſe that they cannot but confeſs, if not all, moſt of the practicals of the Scripture, not to bee againſt, nor above reaſon; but ſuch as whoſoever ſhall obey, and live according to them, that their very enemies cannot but approve of their lives: And this was it that made the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170460:85"/>Chriſtians, both in reſpect of their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and love one among another, and to their enemies, to bee admired and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, even by their perſecutors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they lived: The very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could ſee a beauty in Holineſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince the glorious light and luſtre of the holineſs of the commands of God in Scripture, is ſo clear, that men cannot but be convinc'd, and yet will not obey, no marvel that thoſe ſaving truths of the Goſpel, which cannot bee ſeen by the light of nature, I ſay, 'tis no marvel, that God does not give them of that light which is ſupernatural, ſince they reſiſt, and make no better uſe of their natural light, living quite contrary to thoſe things that teacheth them: And it is obſerved, that one reaſon, why God has not made all his truths ſo clear and demonſtrative, as mathematical natural truths are, is, that he would order matters, ſo that thoſe that were of corrupt mindes, might finde ſome pretences for not believing of them; for to ſuch people God may juſtly ſend ſtrong deluſions; and it may bee, it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even for the people of God, that all wicked men are not fully convinced of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170460:86"/>divine truths, for that would make them much more outragious, and malicious; for thoſe whom the truths of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but not convert, they do inrage, as they do Satan, who believes; and as it does thoſe who commit the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, who hating the truth, they know, are the greateſt and moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious perſecutors; nay, and indeed 'tis a mercy in ſome kinde, even to the wicked alſo; for it is better that they ſhould not know the truths of God, ſince if they did know them, they would not obey them; therefore if thou wilt believe, obey, that is, if thou wilt believe the myſterious truths of the Goſpel, obey the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel, do what thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and thou ſhalt know what as yet thou art ignorant of. I have alſo conſidered with my ſelf, what truth is the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to believe, and to mee it ſeems, that to believe that God hath given his only belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son to die for ſinners, is that truth which we hardlieſt yeeld to. For firſt, our pride is utterly againſt it, for by nature we love to go to heaven by our own merits, and to bee juſtified wholly from another, and for our own works, not ſo much as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170460:86"/>to bee one ingredient in our juſtification, and our own free will to have no hand in our regeneration, and our own good works in our glorification, by way of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the pride of man will not ſtoop to.</p>
                  <p>And then ſecondly, it is utterly againſt humane reaſon, partly, becauſe wee think with our ſelves, that God might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us our ſins, without ſo much ado, as to have his own ſon ſuffer ſo much for us, but wee little conſider that wee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times do many things our ſelves with a great deal of trouble, out of love, which may bee done as well without us; ſo the mother nurſeth her own childe, and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, and doth many other things which ſhee might have done by others as effectually, though ſhee were only a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator. And further, wee muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there are two ſpecial reaſons why God gave his Son, and Chriſt gave himſelf to die for us, chiefly to ſatisfie his juſtice, as alſo to ſatisfie us of his love, and it is not eaſie to ſay, which are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to bee ſatisfied; for 'tis true, that hee that injures, forgives not; wee therefore having ſo much offended God, can hardly forgive him, that is, believe that hee will
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170460:87"/>forgive us; hee therefore to ſatisfie and cure our infidelity, gives us his only ſon to die for us, to give us an infallible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his love, the ſufferings of Chriſt did ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, by way of merit, and our infidelity, by way of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; the ſufferings of Chriſt did recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God to us, and the Spirit of Chriſt doth reconcile us to God: It was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that hee that ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, ſhould bee God, and it is as neceſſary, that hee that ſatisfies us of Gods love, ſhould bee God alſo. Another thing that hinders our belief of this myſtery, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the goodneſs and love of God is ſo exceeding great, that wee cannot believe it, for wee are ſubject to judge of God by our ſelves; and therefore, becauſe we ſhould never ſuffer our onely beloved childe to die a miſerable shameful death, to ſave an enemy, therefore wee judge that God cannot do ſo neither: Hence it is, that the more patient, meek, long-ſuffering wee grow by the grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, the more eaſily do wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his love to us; but if wee truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that which makes this myſtery of love incredible, should make us believe it,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170460:87"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> the greatneſs of it, for ſince God hath ſaid in his Word, that herein hee hath commended and glorified his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love to us, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. therefore it is certain, that this act of love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, muſt as far exceed the acts of our love and goodneſs, as the higheſt acts of his power and wiſdome, do exceed the acts of our power and wiſdome, and wee may come as neer to imitate God in Creation, as in this act of his love; therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.8. and <hi>Pſa.</hi> 103.11. Therefore the very incredibility of this work makes it credible; for if God will magnifie his goodneſs, that work which hee does, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The truth of it is, 'tis as hard for us to believe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the higheſt acts of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and love, as of his power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for God is equally incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in all his Attributes; and wee may as well finde out the depths, and heights, and extent of his power and wiſdome, as the heights, and depths, and extent of his love, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. And 'tis as great a ſin for us to ſay, this is too good for God to do, as to ſay, this is too hard for God to do. The Papiſts vainly bring this as an
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170460:88"/>argument for Tranſubſtantiation, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the incredibility of the work makes it credible, unleſs God had ſaid, that hee did intend to magnifie his power, by turning the bread into Chriſts body; therefore we muſt mortifie firſt our pride, and ſubmit to the righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. The greateſt act of humility in the world is ſo to do, to bee willing to bee ſaved by God through Chriſt, and to take heaven as an almes, and not as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>

Mortifie carnal experiences in thy ſelf, or others, do not ſay, becauſe greater <hi>love no man hath ſhewn then this, to lay down his life for his friend;</hi> that therefore Chriſt would not lay down his life for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; do not ſay, becauſe it is the manner of men, whereſoever they finde their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to ſlay him, or at leaſt, not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, unleſſe hee ſubmits, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will not give his Son for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, before they are reconciled, that they may bee reconciled: give God leave,

                  <p n="4">4. You muſt mortifie the luſts of the fleſh, with the deſires thereof, for before wee are willing to part with our ſins, wee ſhall never bee either able, or willing, to accept of Chriſt, for our ſins do make us ſtrangers and enemies to God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. and the reaſon why Chriſt is a ſtumbling ſtone, is, by reaſon of our diſobedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. This was <hi>Achitophels</hi> ſubtilty, in adviſing <hi>Abſalon</hi> to lie with his Fathers Concubines, for it heightned his enmity to <hi>David,</hi> becauſe it was ſuch an act, that hee could hardly believe <hi>David</hi> could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, ſince hee ſeemed to bee ingaged, not only in point of honour, not to pardon it; therefore, that though it bee true, that through the Almighty power, wiſdome, and goodneſs of God, hee ſo orders it, that when <hi>ſin abounds, grace doth much more abound;</hi> and <hi>Harlots</hi> and <hi>Publicans</hi> are rather brought home than <hi>Phariſees,</hi> yet they were firſt wrought by the Spirit
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170460:89"/>of God to leave their ſins, that is, to accept of Chriſt as a King, as well as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, before they were reconciled to God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Wee muſt mortifie carnal confidence, as long as wee think that wee can do any thing to our own juſtification, wee ſhall never relie on Chriſt, to bee wholly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by him, for wee do not uſe to truſt any other, for that which wee have in our own power: Hence it is, that it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man that truſts in his riches; for ſo the Evangeliſts, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, ſignifie two wayes, men think to bee juſtified, one is, by their not doings, and the other by their doings: I am no murtherer, nor adulterer, nor prophane perſon, ſaith the <hi>Phariſee;</hi> and they being innocent of theſe ſins, as they think, they hope to eſcape hell; then, I give tythes of all I poſſeſs, faſt twice a week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo they think by their good works to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe heaven, and then, becauſe they cannot but bee ſenſible of many failings, both in reſpect of their omitting many good works which they ſhould do, and in committing many ſins which they are forbidden, ſo that their innocency is not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170460:89"/>pure, nor their holineſs perfect; therefore they think to make up that breach by their ſorrow for their ſins, and their ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of tears, ſerves them inſtead of Chriſts ſhedding of his blood; therefore I ſhall ſpeak to theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for their pretended innocency, becauſe they have not committed ſuch and ſuch things, they are exceedingly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in that matter, for they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of theſe ſins which they do not commit, ſince the grounds and ends for which they did not commit them, were carnal; for did they abſtain from thoſe ſins out of love and obedience to God, they would abſtain as well from other ſins, as from them, as for neglect of, and formality in, the performances of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from ſecret ſins, and ſpiritual ſins, and their good works, it is moſt certain, that the iniquity of our holieſt performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is very great, and our beſt righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not only ragged, but filthy too; in our writing after the copies of the Law, wee do not only do as one that writes with a pen, that writes ragged, or divers times caſts no ink, but with a pen that blots, for there are not only careleſnes, divers times,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170460:90"/>of our lives, wherein wee do nothing that is good, but ſcarce a word that wee write, but one letter or other is blotted; ſo not one action, though never ſo holy, but is blurred and defiled. And laſtly, as for our repentance and our ſorrow for ſin, if wee think thereby to bee juſtified, wee ſhall bee condemned, for it being ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, inſtead of appeaſing, provokes Gods wrath. For ſuppoſe a woman that had defiled her husbands bed, and contrived, and endeavoured to murther him, I ſay, ſuppoſe, when ſhee pretending that ſhee was ſorry for it, ſhould uſe no higher an expreſſion than this, that ſhee was as ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that shee had done ſo, that shee had rather have loſt a farthing, if shee had been to chufe, would ſuch an expreſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe, or incenſe? So all the ſorrow that an unregenerate, nay, or a regenerate man hath for his ſins, doth not hold ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to that which hee should have, as the loſſe of a farthing doth to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an husband.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth cauſe of infidelity, is a carnal knowledge of Gods Attributes, and then our apprehenſions of Gods Attributes were carnal, when our high thoughts of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170460:90"/>one of his Attributes, make us abate our eſteem of another; when you cannot think one Attribute to bee infinite, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Attribute to bee finite, as I shall preſently show; and there are three At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, by carnal apprehenſions, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from believing, <hi>viz.</hi> the Majeſty, Holineſſe, and Juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Majeſty of God, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes it more amiable, but doth not abate it; and his Majeſty makes his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more wonderful, but doth not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it: The Majeſty of God ſhould not dazle our eyes ſo, as not to behold his goodneſs: As a great Monarch, ſhould hee marry never ſo poor a beggar, his love that made him marry her, will keep him from contemning of her: So if Chriſt marries a poor ſoul, that love which made him marry her, will keep him from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of her; and his Majeſty that could not keep him from loving her, it will never prevail againſt his love, to make him deſpiſe her, for his Majeſty doth not become greater, nor his love leſſe, Chriſt hath not leſſe love, nor a ſinner leſſe love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, after regeneration; nay, one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Chriſt rejoyceth in his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170460:91"/>is, in reference to his Church; a loving husband, rejoyceth in his own prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this very account, that his Wife ſhall bee made partaker with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Holineſs of God and Chriſt doth not hinder from loving and dying for ſuch miſerable ſinners: For as wee think it ſtrange, that God, who is ſo great, ſhould look after ſuch poor creatures as wee are; wee do not uſe to look after wormes, which way they craul, for fear any hurt ſhould come to them, much leſs after vipers, unleſs it bee to purſue them, and deſtroy them. But the Word of God is plain, that neither his Majeſty, nor holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hinders him from dwelling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with a poor contrite ſpirit: For thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth Eternity, whoſe name is holy, <hi>&amp;c. Eſay</hi> 57.45. The holineſs of God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly magnified upon Chriſt, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral accounts, more than by the praiſes and holineſs of thoſe that are in heaven, for the holineſs of God is not ſo great in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as it was in Chriſt; for one that is in the midſt of the greateſt tortures upon earth, and hath not one ſmile from heaven, and willingly to ſubmit, and to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170460:91"/>lie groaning and roaring, but not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, argueth a great ſtrength of grace; but if thoſe in hell ſhould truſt in God, notwithſtanding hee chaſtiſeth them with Scorpions, this requires more ſtrength, more grace; but for Chriſt ſo fully to ſubmit, as hee did, in his agony, and to truſt in God, notwithſtanding he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him, as to ſay, <hi>Father, into thine hands I will commend my ſpirit;</hi> for ſo the original is, as if hee ſhould ſay, I dare, I will truſt thee, though thou wilt not own mee, as I have already hinted: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it argues more holineſs in convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Publicanes and ſinners, than the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> in avoiding of them.</p>
                  <p>The Juſtice of God is more glorified to punish a thouſand ſubjects for breaking the Law, it may ſeem to be revenge, but nothing beſides the love of Juſtice appears in punishing his ſon for the ſame fault; ſo that the Juſtice of God appeares more in juſtifying ſinners through Chriſt, than in condemning of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. for Juſtice is always ſatisfying in hell, but shal never actually bee ſatisfied; thoſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven do actively glorifie the Juſtice of God, and thoſe in hell paſſively, but Chriſt did both.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>The ſecond means to a godly life, is, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and mortifie our Maſter corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſin.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe next great help to attain the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of holineſs, is, to take ſpecial care for the ſubduing of our maſter ſin, that is the <hi>Goliah,</hi> which if it bee ſlain, the whole Army, and the <hi>Philistines</hi> will fly; therefore there are three things I shall do in this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To shew you the difference between a Maſter ſin, and a reigning ſin, that you may not fight againſt <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Ahab,</hi> who, though hee were ſlaine; the battel would continue; but if <hi>Ahab</hi> bee ſlain, a retreat is founded. Thirdly, ſet down rules and means how to conquer it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Differences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Maſter ſin onely rules over our ſins, but not our graces: The weakeſt grace will conquer it, but any other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, bee it never ſo ſtrong, is ſubdued by it, but a reigning ſin hath none above
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170460:92"/>it, no, not grace it ſelf; nay, indeed there can bee no grace in that ſoul, where ſin reignes; and as the Prince of Devils hath a certain government and rule over the reſt of the evil ſpirits; but God rules over all, and bindes the ſtrong man, and ſpoils his goods: So though our Maſter ſin hath a kinde of dominion over other ſins, and is not in ſubjection to them, yet all are brought into ſubjection to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and the grace of God that is in his Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when ſin reignes, wee give our bodies weapons of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin, our head plots, and our tongue pleads for ſin, ſuch an one cannot endure to hear ſin reproved, or ſpoken againſt; but if ones ſin be only a maſter ſin, and not a reigning ſin, though it may bee found to ſteal away the ſpear and cruſe while wee ſleep; or through violence, ſometimes wee acting by our own ſtrength, and not Gods, wreſt our ſword out of our hands, if wee do not bring in our armes, nor lay them down, wee do not become Souldiers of ſin, wee may become cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Thirdly, Reigning ſin has its Throne and Imperial
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170460:93"/>City in the heart of his Kingdome, but forreiners make their incurſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes into the Land, but ſcarce have any certain abode, or at leaſt not in the heart of the Kingdome: So a Maſter ſin in the Regenerate, has its Imperial Throne in the heart, and in the inward man, ſo that its dominion is over the minde, and the affections, they love the ſins that they commit; but a Maſter ſin in the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate only, prevails ſometimes over, and makes incurſions and inrodes in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and makes him commit ſin, but can never make him love ſin, but <hi>with his minde hee delights in, and ſerves the Law of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If ſin reign, wee have no good thoughts of the Word, wee neither ſee the Holineſs of its commands, nor the juſtneſs of its puniſhments, nor the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor the excellencies of the reward; wee ſhall account its holineſs, preciſeneſs, its puniſhments cruelty, and its reward, vanity: St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of another temper, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The difference betwixt whoredome and rapes, ſo is the difference betwixt the Maſter ſin, and the reigning ſin; hee that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170460:93"/>raviſheth hath his will upon the poor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted woman, but cannot get her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but a harlot ſells her ſelf to work wickedneſs; <hi>Paul</hi> was ſold under ſin by <hi>Adam,</hi> for the forbidden fruit, but <hi>Ahab</hi> ſells himſelf to it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If ſin reign, all Sermons that throw down ſin, and ſpoil its dominions, are counted Treaſon: It is treaſon to ſpeak againſt a reigning ſin, and powerful Preachers are uſed by ſuch perſons as Traytors, or enemies; but in the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, though there bee a Maſter ſin, all powerful, ſearching Sermons, are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Friends, and ſin is accounted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If ſin reignes, whatſoever ſins are ſubdued by it, are reſtrained, but not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; for ſin doth not mortifie ſin, but only impriſons it, and confines it, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that when wee refrain from one ſin, out of a greater love, we have to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wee are not innocent of the ſin wee commit not; nay, ſometime the ground upon which wee abſtain from a ſin, hath ſo much evil in it, that it makes one more guilty, upon abſtaining upon that ground, than if wee ſhould have committed the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170460:94"/>ſin wee abſtained from; but grace mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies ſin.</p>
                  <p>Means to finde out a maſter ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From our enemies; for an enemy is like an Eagle, ſharp-ſighted, to cry out, and open-mouth'd, to tell of our faults.</p>
                  <p>There are two things that keep our friends from telling us them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Unwillingneſs to diſpleaſe, makes our falſe friends unwilling to tell us our faults, but our enemies care not; nay, rather ſtudy to diſpleaſe us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Love makes our true friends una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcern our faults, for love covers a multitude of ſins, ſelf-love makes one not to ſee his own failings, and a friend being <hi>alter idem,</hi> his love doth not onely cover and conceal from others his friends ſins and failings, but from himſelf alſo. This was the way by which <hi>Monacha</hi> came to know that ſhee was ſometimes guilty of intemperance, which one of her companions falling out with her, told her of, upon which ſhee left it: Hee is in a good condition, that ſees more evil in himſelf, than his enemies can. It was a good anſwer for a Phyloſopher to give,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170460:94"/>when one told him of ſuch and ſuch things one ſpoke of him to his diſgrace: Ah, ſayes hee, it ſeemes hee does not know mee, for if hee had, hee would have ſpoken far worſe. And indeed wee have great cauſe to love our enemies, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great advantages wee receive from them; more comfort wee may receive from our friends, but more profit, it may bee, from our enemies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee have thereby an advantage to do higher acts of Religion; for thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies do thee injuries, and thou mayeſt forgive them, and love them, thy friends do thee courteſies, and thou mayeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite them; and it is an higher act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to forgive an injury <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                  <p n="2">2. Thy enemies make thee live more circumſpect and wary, it will teach thee how to watch over thy ſelf; one ſhall hardly bee wiſe, before one hath lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt enemies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thine enemies will tell thee thoſe faults thou would'ſt never finde out thy ſelf, nor thy friends for thee, they look upon thy faults with a multiplying glaſs, which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170460:95"/>not only does magnifie and aggravate thy ſins, that thy ſelf or others ſee, but diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thoſe that none elſe perceives; as a Multiplying-glaſs, does not only make a grain of wheat which wee ſee without it, bigger than a large beam, but diſcovers a Down upon each grain, which without that glaſs wee perceive not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing to diſcover our Maſter ſin, is, by the company wee keep; for <hi>ſocii aut inveniunt, aut facient ſimilem;</hi> One had two daughters, <hi>Julia</hi> and <hi>Livia,</hi> and at a publike meeting hee obſerv'd who courted them, and hee found that grave Senatours did court the one, and light Gallants the other, whereby hee plainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="5 letters">

                     </gap>e other more looſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third rule to know thy Maſter ſin, is, by conſidering what vice thou moſt hateſt, the contrary vice to that, is the vice to which thou art moſt inclin'd, as if thou hateſt prodigality moſt, it is likely thou art given to covetouſneſſe; if thou ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreſt idols, take heed thou doſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſacriledge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The fourth rule is, to conſider what ſins thou art free from, and then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170460:95"/>what ſin it is that wil lnot ſtand and agree with thoſe ſins thou art free from, and thou wilt finde that to bee thy Maſter ſin: As for example, Doeſt thou not revenge? Art thou not guilty of glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, drunkenneſs, whoredome? but art guilty of ſwearing, extortion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then it is very probable, that covetouſneſs is thy reigning ſin, for covetouſneſſe will free one from all chargeable ſins: So if thou wilt know whether pride bee thy Maſter ſin, conſider what ſins pride frees one from, and that frees one generally from all ſcandalous ſins, and rather from thoſe that the world moſt ſpeaks againſt, than thoſe that are of greateſt guilt in themſelves, it will rather free thee from drunkenneſs and whoredome, than from blaſphemy, for ſin may free one from ſin, as well as grace; but herein lies the differences:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When grace frees one from ſin, it frees from all ſin, it cleanſes one from all filthineſs, both of fleſh and ſpirit; but when ſin frees one from ſin whilſt it frees one from one ſin, it inclines one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as covetouſneſs, though it may free one from drunkenneſs and prodigality,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170460:96"/>yet it inclines one to extortion, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When fin frees one from ſin, it frees one not at all times; as pride will not free one from any ſin, if one can but keep it ſecret, nor covetouſneſs from revenge, gluttony, or drunkenneſs, when one may have them of free coſt; but grace frees one from ſecret ſins.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſin may free one from the outward act of ſin, but not from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection to ſin; covetouſneſs may keep us from the outward act of revenge, when 'tis chargeable, but not from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward love and deſire of it.</p>
                  <p>The fifth rule to know our Maſter ſin, is, to conſider what ſins you are moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to; as ſuppoſe to revenge, cenſuring of others, anger, envy, then you are to conſider from what root theſe ſpring, for that is not alwayes thy Maſter ſin, which doth moſt appear, but rather the root whence that doth ſpring: So that if thou art very paſſionate, paſſion is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly thy Maſter ſin, but pride, from whence that ſprings, for from pride comes contention; therefore it is good to know from what root ſprings thoſe ſeveral ſins
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170460:96"/>wee are guilty of; from pride comes (as before wee have ſaid) anger, revenge, envy, ambition, cenſuring others; thou wilt bee more ready to forgive a debt, than an injury, and more ready to bear a loſs, than an ill word; from covetouſneſs proceed inlarged deſires of earthly things, continual cares and fears, diſcontent with ones condition, neglect of the works of charity, &amp;c. from voluptuouſneſs comes idleneſs, adultery, gluttony, drunkenneſs, &amp;c. for the works of the fleſh are ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that they need not, and ſo filthy, that they ſhould not bee nam'd amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth rule is, to conſider what places of Scripture that concern practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, do moſt affect, and moſt afflict thee, what places they are that thou haſt moſt ado to expound, ſo as to quiet thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and then mark what ſin thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſpeak againſt, or condemn, or what duty they commend, and by that you may diſcover what ſin it is that lies in your boſome, what Treatiſes they are that you like not to read, that are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or what Sermons they are that ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle you; and as before, conſider what
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170460:97"/>ſins they are thoſe Sermons reprove.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider what ſin it is that thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſpeakeſt againſt, with limitations, cautions, and diſtinctions; but againſt the contrary ſin thou doſt ſpeak without limitations, but abſolutely with freedome, both of ſpeech and ſpirit: As when a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man ſpeaks againſt covetouſneſſe, hee ſpeaks as <hi>David</hi> did to his Army, when they went out againſt <hi>Abſolon, Deal kindly with the young man Abſolo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> ſaid <hi>David;</hi> as if hee had ſaid, 'tis true, hee lay with my Concubines, but hee is a young man; and as hee, ſo they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take off the bitterneſs of our ſpirits againſt the ſin they ſeem to ſpeak againſt; but when a covetous man ſpeaks againſt prodigality, then <hi>vox non faucibus haeret:</hi> But hee ſpeaks with that freedom, and with that earneſtneſs, that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that hee accounts it an enemy that hee deals withal.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Another rule is this, when thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſpeak'ſt againſt ſuch a ſin, when its contrary, is ſpoken againſt, but not <hi>e contra.</hi> As for example, when one ſpeaks againſt covetouſneſs, a covetous man will alwayes ſpeak againſt prodigality: I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170460:97"/>but, ſaith hee, hee is worſe than an Infidel that provides not for his family; and will tell you of the example of the Piſmires, and many other places of Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that are prodigal in expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not diligent in getting riches; but if hee ſpeak againſt prodigality, you ſhall not have him ſpeak a word againſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; there's <hi>altum ſilentium.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</p>
                  <p>The ninth rule to know thy Maſter ſins, what they are, Are thine afflictions painful, or ſhameful, or ſuch as take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy profit, as poverty; generally God does ſtrike us in the maſter vein: Thoſe that belong unto him, if pride bee their maſter ſin, hee ſends them an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that brings ſhame upon them, if covetouſneſſe, hee ſends loſſes, if volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs, ſuch afflictions as are painful. Now in wicked men hee does clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, generally gives them their hearts deſire; ſo that if they bee proud and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, hee lets them have honours, and the praiſe of men, if they love riches, they are generally rich, for God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally gives them their portion in this world; as it was ſaid to the rich man;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170460:98"/>
                     <hi>Son, remember thou receivedſt thy good things in this life.</hi> Though this rule holds not alwayes, neither the rules formerly name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if one takes them ſinglely they will not bee ſufficiently diſcovered; but when many of theſe meet together, they give very great light, for the underſtanding and finding out of our Maſter ſin. There are other rules alſo from our age, our callings, or from the places and times wherein wee live; but I haſten to the cures of this our Maſter ſin.</p>
                  <p>The firſt cure is, to read the Scripture, and gather together all thoſe places that ſpeak any thing concerning that ſin, or the contrary grace, or concerning the acts of either of them; as if Pride were the ſin thou would'ſt eſpecially cure, write down all thoſe places that ſpeak either of pride, or of humility, or of the acts of either as of cenſuring, of a high look, or a ſcornful eye, or of anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſhalt thou ſee what the judgement of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is of that ſin, and ſo thou ſhalt know its ſinfulneſſe, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt that ſin; and ſo thou ſhalt know its miſchiefs; thou ſhalt finde alſo the promiſes that God makes
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170460:98"/>to the contrary grace, and the acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; thou ſhalt alſo finde ſeveral cures and remedies ſet down by the Spirit of God, which are alwayes the ſafeſt and beſt. For though many times humane reaſon judgeth others to bee more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, yet hee that will be wiſer than God, ſhall finde himſelf a fool.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Improve Ordinances and duties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy ſin; as when thou goeſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lords Supper, let one end and aim of thy receiving of it, bee to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that ſin: For though the Lords Supper bee a ſpiritual medicine and antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſin, yet it works eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, for the remedy whereof it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially taken: Bee ſure in all thy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and ejaculatory prayers, eſpecially to pray againſt this ſin, let it have no quiet poſſeſſion. Read alſo thoſe Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, eſpecially that write againſt the ſin, or of the contrary grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Improve thine acquaintance againſt this ſin; if thy ſin bee anger, acquaint thy ſelf with meek perſons; for as hee that keeps company with angry perſons, will learn their wayes: So if thy ſin bec pride, bee acquainted with thoſe that are
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170460:99"/>humble, and bee often in their company; three great advantages come by it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will hinder thee from many acts of that ſin; for even as prophane perſons do very much abſtain from all ſin, when they are in the company of Saints; ſo wilt thou alſo bee aſhamed to commitacts of pride, in the company of one that is eminent for humility.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such an one will bee more able to diſcern, even the moſt minute and ſmalleſt acts of pride in thee; and if it bee thy Chriſtian friend, for, for that end I would have thee chuſe him, hee will reprove thee, not only for groſs acts of pride, but for the appearances thereof: As he that's acquainted with a Critick in Latin, ſhould not only bee admoniſhed of him of incongruous Latin, but alſo of un-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The conſtant examples of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo of other graces, will, as it were, transform thee into that image.</p>
                  <p>The fourth remedy is, to reſiſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of ſin, and that advice is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is <hi>principium reſpectu affectus, &amp; per modum cauſae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:170460:99"/>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Reſpectu gradus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Reſpectu conſuetudinis,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Therefore the firſt advice is cure the cauſe of your ſin, if you will cure your ſin; as hee that would cure heat in the face, the way is, not by application of outward medicines only, but cure the cauſe of it, the indiſpoſition of the liver from whence the blood comes to bee vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated; ſo to cure anger, the beſt way is, by curing the cauſe and root from whence it ſprings, pride; for generally, if not alwayes, it comes from pride, the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of anger, I mean, for to cut off the branches only, keeps the tree from bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit for a while, but pull it up by the root, and it is cured for ever: So I would have you finde out the root, and cauſe of the ſin you finde your ſelf addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to, if it have a root, and apply your remedies to the root.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Principium reſpectu graduum.</hi> Then the advice is, before the ſin gets ſtrength, and comes to an height, to its Paroxiſme; for every thing is weak, and eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at the beginning, which afterward grows invincible: As when one firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to bee angry, one may eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170460:100"/>but after it becomes outragious, and will neither follow, nor hear any counſel, nay, advice in the height of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is as Phyſick in the Paroxiſm of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, dangerous.</p>
                  <p>The third advice is, <hi>in principio, reſpectu conſuetudinis,</hi> before thy ſin grows cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary; for when once thou art accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do evil, then the <hi>Blackmoor</hi> may as ſoon change his skin, and the <hi>Leopard</hi> his ſpots, as thou thy ſin, ſaith the Prophet. So then there are three wayes, in reſpect of the beginnings of ſin, to conquer it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the root and ſpring from whence it ariſeth, and then, as hath been ſaid, your main application muſt bee to the root, not to the branches; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times that which ſeems to bee the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſin, is not, but is rather like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who acted all, but hee did it by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who though hee appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> could do nothing, but by commiſſion and power derived from him: So Anger, that makes the great noiſe, and ſeems to bee the Maſter ſin in thoſe that are paſſionate; but the ſpring of it is pride, which though it appears
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170460:100"/>not yet by its power and influence, anger does what it does; therefore thou art to ſeeke out the root of that which ſeems to bee the Maſter ſin: And there are three grand ſins, from which generally all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do proceed, Pride, Covetouſneſſe, Voluptuouſneſſe, though indeed all theſe come from one, which is ſelf-love; therefore do but learn that ſingular leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which Chriſt gives, and thou ſhalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both root and branch of ſin, <hi>viz. He that will bee my Diſciple, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaith Chriſt:</hi> Self is the great enemy that every man has.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the beginning of ſin, in reſpect of his degree, watchfulneſs is the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar remedy: For if we have a continual watch over our words and actions, nay, even our thoughts, wee ſhall ſee ſin in its beginnings; nay, even in its firſt motions, and occaſions, and temptations; and ſo wee may either prevent, or at leaſt take it, before it comes to its Paroxiſme: And the beginnings of ſin, as of all other things, are weak, and eaſily ſubdued.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And as for the preventing of ſin, that it comes not to bee cuſtomary, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for that is, frequent examination; for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170460:101"/>by often examining our ſelves, wee ſhall diſcover our ſins, as ſoon almoſt as wee commit them, and ſo they will bee kept from being habitual and cuſtomary; therefore let the examination of thy ſelf be at leaſt <hi>Diurnal,</hi> ſo that no ſin can be above a day old, before thou perceiveſt it; and ſo if thou canſt not ſtrangle it in its birth, thou mayeſt in its cradle. I ſuppoſe one need not bee a Giant to encounter with a Lion, as ſoon as it is whelpt, or to pull up an Oke, when the Acorn firſt ſprouts forth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth advice is, concerning temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and three advices there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning temptations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning the foreſeeing of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, it is good in every action, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what temptations wee are like to bee encountred withal in that action; as when you go to hear the Word, conſider what temptations are incident to that. And ſo in all holy duties. Ordinances, and worldly imployments: For if a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on takes us unawares, a weak temptation will prevail more, than a ſtrong fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond advice concerning temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170460:101"/>is, to prepare and provide for them; as one adviſes, that if you know you are to ſpeak with a paſſionate man, you are not only to foreſee, that you are likely to provoke him, and hee you to paſſion, but you are to provide remedies againſt both, either by preparing molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying words, or taking with you ſome perſon, whoſe preſence may awe, or ſuch like.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But you are to avoid all the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that you can, ſo that you do not neglect a duty, to avoid a temptation; for it is preſumption to run into unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary temptations, and it is ſpiritual co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe to neglect our juſt imployments, becauſe a Lion is in the ſtreet: And as I have elſewhere ſaid, when one has once found ones ſelf overcome with ſuch a temptation frequently, then it is a ſin to go into that temptation, though one bee not overcome by it.</p>
                  <p>And it is a great fault in parents, when they diſpoſe of their children, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what callings have the moſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations accompanying them; and they ſhould conſider of what callings there are few that are religious in, and utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170460:102"/>diſpoſing of their children to ſuch a calling; for if the calling bee not in it ſelf unlawful, yet it ſhewes the temptations that accompany it, are ſo many, that it is almoſt impoſſible to avoid and overcome them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The next adivce is, concerning thy ſpeech: As often as occaſion is given, ſpeak againſt the vice thou would'ſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and three advantages you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By often ſpeaking againſt it, thy heart will bee brought into ſome meaſure of hatred of it; for as by evil communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, good manners are corrupted, ſo by good communication, thy heart will bee inclined to the beſt things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will keep thee from many a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for when thou ſhalt bee known to ſpeak againſt ſuch a ſin, people will more hardly entice thee to commit it, or commit it themſelves in thy preſence: As it is reported of one, that ſhee was ſo great an enemy to cenſuring, and ſpeaking ill of others, that it came to a Proverb, <hi>that if ſuch an one was preſent, they were ſure that they were not ſtandered at that time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It does ſtrongly ingage thee, not to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170460:102"/>commit that ſin which thou ſo frequently condemneſt;</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Another advice is, to divert thy thoughts and ſpeech to ſome other thing; and this advice takes place in luſts, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring or ſpeaking ill of others, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous thoughts; for the Apoſtle bids us not ſo much to reſiſt, as to fly fleſhly luſts: Other ſins wee are to reſiſt, theſe to fly from; for a chaſte Matron rather avoids the room, when a lewd man ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites her to uncleanneſs, than ſtands long to diſpute the queſtion. So <hi>Joſeph</hi> flies from his Miſtreſs: And ſo alſo in blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thoughts, they are to bee abhor'd, not to bee diſputed withal, they are not to bee thought over again, for the benefit in abhorring of it, will hardly recompence the horror that ſuch thoughts bring with them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The next advice is, concerning vowes and reſolutions, concerning which, ſince in that which I have already publiſhed, concerning vowes, in my Treatiſe of my Meditations, I have given rules, I refer to them.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="chapter">

                  <head>CHAP. III <hi>The next help for the attainment of the Power of Godlineſs, are Ejaculatory prayers.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe next thing that I ſhall ſpeak to, which is of unſpeakable ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, are Ejaculatory prayers, which do firſt honor God much in his Attributes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In his Omniſciency, I mean mental ejaculatory prayers, for generally all men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal prayers are ejaculatory, and by this we profeſs, that God is Omniſcient, that hee knows our thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It honours Gods mercy abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for wee ſuppoſe that God is ſo ready to hear, and waits to ſhew mercy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. that the ſwifteſt, ſhorteſt prayer, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a diſtinguiſhing note between regenerate, and unregenerate perſons, for ſolemn prayer, publike family, cloſet prayer, an hypocrite may perform them, but not frequent, mental, ejaculatory pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By this means the ſoul muſt needs be perfumed, and inflamed, and eſtabliſhed;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170460:103"/>as hee that is often in a Perfumers Shop, and at the fire, muſt needs retain much of the heat of the one, and the ſweet ſents of the other.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe ejaculatory prayers keep us in a perpetual fitneſs for ſolemn prayer; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of muſick, that are ſeldome plaid on, though they bee left never ſo well in tune, yet if hung by for any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, will grow out of tune, and unfit to play on, without retuning of them: So our hearts, except continually exerciſed by ejaculatory prayer, will looſe that ſweet harmony they had, nor will bee fit for ſolemn duties, without further preparation; but one that continually multiplies ejaculatory prayers, is alwayes in ſuch a frame of heart, as is fit for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayer.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This is the way to keep God always with us in a friendly preſence; for if ſo be ones friend, comes to ſee one, if ones buſines bee of that nature, that one cannot ſpeak with him from morning to night; or if it bee not of that nature, as divers kindes of imployments are, if one would not ſo much as minde him, hee leaves us; but if wee will converſe with him, though we
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170460:104"/>bee doing ſomething elſe, hee ſtayes with us: So if thy heart bee continually ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God by ejaculatory prayers, hee will not forſake thee; but if you will not by ejaculatory prayers ſpeak one word to God, when thy ſolemn prayer is ended, thou mayeſt not expect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God at other times, nay, nor then neither.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thou wilt miſs of abundance of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and mercies, if thou neglecteſt eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory prayers; for divers times thou wilt finde, while thou art in conference with the people of God, or reading ſome good book, &amp;c. that thine heart will bee ſometimes inflamed with the love of God, and deſires after enjoyments of him, thou wilt bee brought to the ſight and ſenſe of thine own unworthineſs and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wants, ſo that thou wilt finde many things that thou ſtandeſt in need of, for which it is very fit that thou ſhould'ſt put up thy prayers to God, and while the ſenſe of theſe things do affect thee, thou wilt pray with more zeal and fervency; but if thou wilt refer all to thy ſolemn prayers, and ſay to thy ſelf, <hi>As ſoon as the company is gone, and I have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170460:104"/>for ſolemn prayer, then I will poure out my ſoul before God:</hi> But by this meanes two great miſchiefes will befall thee.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may bee that frame of heart may ceaſe, and thou not ſtriking while the iron is hot, ten times more ſtrength and time will not ſerve.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou canſt not keep in minde all thoſe things which thou waſt moved to pray or praiſe God for, for in an hour or two, eſpecially if wee are in conference with the people of God, a multitude of occaſions, of ejaculatory prayers, will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, which it is almoſt impoſſible for thee to remember, if thou neglecteſt them, when they offer themſelves unto thee; and if thou canſt remember them, when thou comeſt to thy ſolemn prayers, thy former ejaculatory prayers will not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but further thee in the duty.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This is the way to ſpiritualize all our worldly imployments, this is our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our converſation in heaven. I have heard it reported of one, that hee kept a ſtricter communion with God, whilſt hee was walking in the ſtreets, than ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians did on their knees: By this means worldly objects, that take up the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170460:105"/>thoughts of wicked men in their worldly imployments, and alſo in holy duties: I ſay, thoſe worldly objects that diſtract others, will ſerve to imminde thee of, and give thee matter of more frequent ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations unto God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The want of ejaculatory prayers, cannot bee any way ſupplied, not by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn duties; and if the caſe were ſo, that wee muſt omit one of them, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to omit our ſolemn prayer in the morning, and to have our heart ſending up continually ejaculatory prayers, and breathings after God, than to ſpend an hour in the morning in ſolemn prayer, and meditation, and all the reſt of the day not to have ſo much as one thought of God. One that were to write or read all day in exceeding cold weather, which of theſe two do you think hee would chuſe? either to bee an hour at a good fire in the morning, but not to come neer it all the reſt of the day, or an hundred times a day, if hee ſo pleaſed, to go and ſtay a while, and warm himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to his imployment; though both were beſt, yet the laſt, if they muſt bee ſever'd, were to bee choſen, as to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170460:105"/>warmth. By our ejaculatory prayers wee do frequently warm our ſouls, and keep the heat of the love of God from going out in us.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Theſe are the firſt and laſt prayers of every Saint; as ſoon as hee is new born, hee cries <hi>Abba,</hi> Father; or with <hi>Paul, Lord, what wilt thou have mee to do?</hi> and it is the laſt thing that a Saint doth when hee comes to die: An ejaculatory, fervent, inflamed prayer, is the fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, which carries the ſoul of every Saint to heaven: So our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into thine hands I commend my ſpirit;</hi> when hee dies, and takes his leave of praying, it is by an ejaculatory prayer; and ſo it is the firſt and laſt of all ſolemn duties, it prevents, and prepares us for them: When a man is converted, as hee is hearing the Word, hee cannot ſtay while hee comes home to ſolemn prayer, but is ſending up ſparks, and ejaculato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayers, from the time that hee is wrought upon by God, it is the (Amen) which cloſeth up all our prayers, for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is but an ejaculation, great fires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and end in a ſpark: So <hi>David</hi> ends his Pſalm with an ejaculatory prayer, <hi>Pſalm</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:170460:106"/>19.14. As in a bell, when it ringeth out, if you let it go, it will not ceaſe of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but will ſtrike many a Toll before it quite ceaſeth; ſo the Soul, after ſolemn duties, hath ſome motions, and returnes, and callings upon God. Mark thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn duties, which you have begun without ejaculatory prayers, by way of preparation, and have ended without any conſequent breathings after God, you ſhall finde ſuch duties much leſſe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. This is the way to weary out Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as a City is wearied out by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Aſſaults and Alarums, for every ejaculatory prayer gives Satan a freſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm; ſo that by this means thou doſt never let Satan alone. <hi>Solomon</hi> compares a contentious Wife to a continual drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.13. one that rideth in a great ſhoure, if the reſt of the day be hot and fair, his cloaths will bee dried again; but one that rideth in continual dropping weather, cannot bee dry; ſo a contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wife never ſuffers her husband to have a quiet hour: A ſolemn fervent prayer, is like a great ſhoure in a journey, very diſturbing to Satan, but hee will
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170460:106"/>recover himſelf; but continual ejaculato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayers (like a contentious woman) will never let Satan have a quarter of an hours reſt; ſo it alſo will eat out our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, <hi>Gutta cavat lapidem non vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="12">12. Ejaculatory prayers are the freeſt from diſtraction, whether it is, becauſe they generally ariſe from the heart, except in prophane perſons, who have their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomary <hi>O Lords,</hi> and <hi>Lord have mercy upon mee,</hi> without thinking of God whom they name, who are neer of Kin to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſwearers; or whether they being ſo ſhort, ſudden, and mental, they do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken Satan to tempt us, until they bee over; and then, though they awaken him, yet they weaken him alſo: As for ſolemn prayers, our preparations to them, if only by the alteration of our geſtures, gives notice to Satan what wee are about to do; but in ejaculatory prayers, wee have done, as ſoon as Satan perceives what wee are a doing; hee cannot ſhoot
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170460:107"/>any of his darts, that are ſet on fire of hell, ſo ſoon againſt us; but our darts, that is, an ejaculatory prayer, ſet on fire with the love of God, will bee in heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Theſe kinde of prayers are very powerful, one of the ſtrangeſt Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that wee read of in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Heathen King that had led the Jewes captive, ſhould bee ſo active in building, and re-building the Temple. I ſay, that was attained by a mental ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory prayer, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.4. and a vocal eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory prayer, obtained a vocal anſwer from heaven, <hi>John</hi> 12.28. By Chriſts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculatory Prayer on the Croſſe, <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do,</hi> thouſands were converted, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. So the converſion of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> was procured by the ejaculatory prayer of <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. In theſe kinde of prayers eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God deals familiarly with man, and doth, as it were, put off the robes of his Majeſty; or rather, God ſuffers man to deal familiarly with him; for in our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayers wee do, as thoſe that with a great deal of ceremony and diſtance, and abundance of outward reverence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170460:107"/>a Petition to a great Monarch, who doth not hereby abate any thing of his Majeſty, nor doth the delivering of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition ſo, argue any familiarity or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but if one ſhall ſee one ſpeaking two or three words to the King, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as hee pleaſed to ſpeak ſo to the King, wee ſhould argue, that hee had the Kings ear, and that the King dealt after a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar way with him: So our ſolemn duties do not argue our acquaintance with God ſo much, as theſe ejaculatory prayers: A ſtranger may deliver a Petition in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn way, wee give God the glory of his Majeſty more in our ſolemn prayers, but God doth more glorifie his goodneſſe and condeſcention, in giving us leave to uſe frequent ejaculatory prayers.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. They may bee moſt frequent; ſo that what they want in magnitude, may bee ſupplied by their number: It's a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb among ſome, <hi>that light gains make a heavy purſe;</hi> ſo thoſe ſpiritual gains, by ejaculatory prayers, though it ſeems to bee ſmall and light, yet will much encreaſe the weight, both of grace and glory: So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn duties can bee but ſeldome, ſince they require retirement, and more time,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170460:108"/>than this kinde of prayer doth, though wee read but of three times of ſolemn prayer that <hi>Daniel</hi> uſed, and ſeven times that <hi>David</hi> uſed it, yet it may juſtly bee thought, that ejaculatory prayers were, or might bee without number.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Theſe kinde of prayers, if wee uſe not, there is no excuſe, for 1. They hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nothing, they hinder not cuſtomers from coming to your Shop, nor them that come from buying, they diſturb no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but they are like Varniſh, that puts a luſtre on all colours, but changeth them not; it makes a vermilion colour, not leſs red, but orient; like the Bee that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers honey from every flower, but leaves it as fragrant and beautiful as ſhee found it.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. As they hinder no buſineſs, ſo no buſineſs hinders them, riding, ſelling, walking; nay, nor ſleeping hinders theſe prayers, although thou ſleepeſt, thy heart may wake; thoſe that keep thee from ſolemn prayer, cannot keep thee from theſe, thy perſon may bee impriſoned, but not thy prayers; though they ſhould cut out thy tongue, as they did <hi>Policarpus</hi> his, and ſo keep thee from vocal, yet
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170460:108"/>they cannot hinder thee from mental prayer; wicked perſecutors may hinder ſolemn, but nothing but a wicked heart can hinder from ejaculatorie prayers.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. It ſhewes, that thou art but an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, that is, a <hi>Stage-player,</hi> for ſo the word properlie ſignifies, for thou doſt carry thy ſelf juſt as they do; for the Church is but a ſtage for hipocrites to act their parts in: For as thoſe that act upon a Stage, their fear, joy, ſorrow, though they are acted to the life, yet as ſoon as the <hi>Play</hi> is done, there remains not any impreſſion of theſe affections; if he was ſad before, though hee acted a Part, of joy, returns to his former ſadneſs; and if hee acted the Part of ſorrow, yet hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains not ſad when the Play is done, for that matter which hee pretended to bee ſo much grieved for on the Stage, but for that for which hee was affected before; nay, while hee acted his Part of ſorrow, it was not that which hee pretended to bee ſorrie for, but his former cauſe of grief hath made him act ſo to the life: So when Hipocrites confeſs their ſins, as ſoon as ever their prayer is ended, and their confeſſion is ended, they return to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170460:109"/>their imployments, there remaines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their acted ſorrowes; nay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times when an hypocrite ſeems to weep for his ſins, while hee is confeſſing of them, his teares flow from another fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> from the ſenſe of ſome affliction that lies heavy on him. Now, if when thy prayer is done, thy joyes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, deſires, breathings after God, all expire with the laſt word of thy ſolemn prayer, it ſhewes, that thou haſt been but acting of a part; for ſorrowes that are rooted and fixed in us, do not fall from their paroxiſme quite to ceaſe, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: When did you ever ſee a tender mother, that was weeping, like <hi>Rachel</hi> for her children, to fall from the heighth of her ſorrowes, to mirth and laughter, ſuch a carriage is rather fit for thoſe that were hired to mourn at Funerals amongſt the Jewes, than for thoſe that imploid them.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. No temporal or ſpiritual imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can bee rightlie mannaged without it; while thou art ſelling thy wares, thou wilt danger to ſell thy ſoul alſo; while thou art walking in the ſtreet this way, thou mayeſt bee journeying toward hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But I ſhall rather endeavour to ſhew
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170460:109"/>it in holy duties, it is an excellent practiſe to uſe theſe ejaculatory prayers, while we are hearing the Word, I mean mental e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculatorie prayers, for vocal may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb others, and eſpecially ſavour too much of hipocriſie; yet I will not judge thoſe that uſe it, for I do not finde our Saviour doth blame them that uſed vocal ejaculatorie prayer, while he was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.34. And though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would not interrupt our Saviour with any queſtion, whilſt he was Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſtayed while bee came into the houſe privatelie, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.17. Yet while hee was preaching, they ſent an <hi>ejaculato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayer, Luke</hi> 17.5. and were blameleſs. When thou heareſt any grace commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how canſt thou abſtain (as ſuppoſe Faith) <hi>Lord encreaſe my faith:</hi> So if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſin reproved, and thou findeſt thy ſelf guiltie of it, thou may'ſt, and ſhould'ſt in the ſecret of thy ſoul ſay, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to my charge.</hi> If a Sermon preach'd of the Excellencie of Chriſt, that Bread that came down from heaven, why may'ſt thou not ſay as they did, <hi>John</hi> 6.34. <hi>Lord, evermore give us of this bread;</hi> nay, wee read that our bleſſed Saviour, while hee
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170460:110"/>was preaching, in the midſt of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, breaks forth into a <hi>vocal ejaculatory prayer, Ma.</hi> 11.25. And ſurelie, while Miniſters are preaching, they may finde ſometimes, I wiſh it were not often, that their hearts are cold in the ſervice, either not actuallie, or not ſo ferventlie deſiring the glorie of God, and edification of his people; then by an <hi>ejaculatory</hi> filent <hi>prayer</hi> to fetch ſtrength from heaven, is of great advantage; nay, even in ſolemn prayer, theſe <hi>ejaculatory prayers</hi> are to bee mixt: For when one findes ones heart dead and cold, then to call down fire from heaven to inflame us, is of great and frequent uſe; and indeed the benefit of <hi>ejaculatory prayers</hi> is not to bee known, but by experience; and therefore I ſhall commend it as one of the greateſt helps that I know.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But if you ſhall object and ſay, I have abundance of worldlie imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and I muſt follow my particular calling, as for familie prayer, morning and evening, and for Cloſet prayer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I think them fit, and am content to do them; but to tell mee, that I muſt be frequent in theſe <hi>ejaculatory prayers</hi> in my
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170460:110"/>Shop, as I am ſelling, or buying, &amp;c. is a thing I cannot do, for I muſt minde my buſineſs I am about.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. 1. Speak out, and mince not the matter, but let thy heart ſpeak out, for God verie well ſees the thoughts of it; and give mee leave to ſpeak what thy heart thinks: My Shop, and my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling, and to get riches, is my great buſineſs; for matters of Religion, and in particular for <hi>prayer,</hi> in the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my cuſtomers come, or at night when they are gone, I am content to uſe them, ſince it is a general cuſtome ſo to do; but for the reſt of the day, I deſire to be free, and that God would not trouble me with the motions of his Spirit, the reſt of the day: For though hee deſires but a word or two, by way of anſwer, in <hi>ejaculatory prayers,</hi> yet that's a diſturbance, though when by his Spirit hee ſpeaks to my heart, <hi>Seek thou my face,</hi> for mee to anſwer, <hi>thy face, Lord, will I ſeek,</hi> were enough, and hee will accept of it; yet this is an interruption. Let mee tell thee, thou that canſt not tell how to keep communion with God in worldlie imployments, and doeſt not prize communion with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170460:111"/>all worldlie imployments, art not worthie of him; thou mayſt bee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, but thou art no Saint.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I muſt ask thee, whether thou art as much againſt this, that worldlie thoughts ſhould mingle themſelves with thy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayers, as that holie thoughts ſhould bee mingled with thy worldlie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; and this ſhewes the rottenneſs of thy heart, that thou wilt admit the world to come and ſpeak with thee in the midſt of thy ſolemn duties, or converſe with God, but wilt not afford God a word, or a look, while thou art converſing with the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe ejaculatorie prayers will not hinder, but ſanctifie thine imployments; the having thy thoughts frequentlie upon God and heaven, will keep thee from all unlawful gains, from grinding the face of the poor, in buying, and making advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ignorance of the buyer in ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and this indeed is the reaſon why thou loveſt not to have thoughts of God at ſuch times, for they awaken thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo that thou canſt not ſin ſo ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and without diſturbance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thy not having frequent thoughts
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170460:111"/>of God, in the midſt of thy worldlie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, ſhewes, that thou doeſt not follow thy particular calling out of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, but out of love to riches, ſo that thou haſt given the world thy heart: It is a better frame of heart, to bee willing to obey God, when hee bids us buy and ſell, &amp;c. but to rejoyce to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, when hee bids us pray: When the duties of Gods immediate ſervice ſerve as recreations, to ſweeten and lighten the burthen of thy particular calling, and not the works of thy particular calling; as things that ſweeten duties of Religion, when thou calleſt the Sabbath a delight, and ſayeſt, <hi>when will the Sabbath come,</hi> and not, <hi>when will it bee done:</hi> This is that frame of heart, from which ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie prayers proceed. But you will ſay, how ſhall I gain this heavenly art, to bee frequent in ejaculatorie prayers? I ſhall add therefore to what I have ſaid ſome directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Get thy heart inflamed with the love of God, and of ſpiritual things, and then thou needeſt ſcarce any other means or helps; for it is impoſſible to give ones love to God, and keep ones thoughts from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170460:112"/>God; then theſe holy ſparks will not bee like thoſe that are ſtruck out of a flint, procured by violence and force, but like ſparks, coming from the fire of their own accord; and as the ſparks, ſo forced from a flint, fall downward, but ſparks from the fire, fly upward; ſo thoſe thoughts of God, and thoſe ejaculatorie prayers that proceed not from the flames of love, but from a flinty ſtony heart, are earthie, and to earth they return.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Bee frequent in reading the Pſalmes of <hi>David</hi> and the <hi>Song of Solomon,</hi> for they are the breathings of an inflamed, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick ſoul; and thou ſhalt find ſtore of theſe ejaculatorie prayers and praiſes; as, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within mee, praiſe his holy Name, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and what is there on earth that I deſire, in compariſon of thee?</hi> and ſo in a multitude of Pſalmes; as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.148, 150. &amp;c. for indeed it is a Store-houſe of theſe kinde of prayers, in all occaſions, whether of ſpiritual joy, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, love deſire, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Obſerve providences, and all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, for there is nothing almoſt, that thou ſeeſt or heareſt, but thou may'ſt eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170460:112"/>ſpiritualize. It is ſtored of M. <hi>Dod,</hi> who intending to marrie, but being troubled with fears and cares, how hee ſhould bee able to live in that condition, ſince his incomes were but ſmall, and but enough to maintain him in an unmarried condition; looking out of the Window, and ſeeing a Hen ſcraping for food for her numerous brood about her, thought thus with himſelf: This Hen did but live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had theſe Chickens, and now ſhee lives with all her little ones; upon which hee added this thought alſo, I ſee the Fowles of the Ayr neither ſow nor reap, nor gather into barnes, and yet my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlie Father feeds them: And if thou getteſt that ſpiritual Art, like the Bee, to draw ſweetneſs from everie flower; and if thou canſt turn everie thing thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and ſeeſt, into holy meditations, theſe ejaculatorie prayers will come of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for holy thoughts of God, end in holy prayers to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Get a ſenſe of thy own vileneſs, and inabilitie of doing any thing that is good, or reſiſting any thing that is evil, and that will make thee cry to God upon all occaſions, whether of dutie or temptation.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:170460:113"/>
                  <p n="5">5. Hinder not the motions and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit upon thee, quench not the Spirit, and the Spirit of God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame thee; for when the fire of his love is kindled in thy heart, what would hee, but that it ſhould burn? nay, wee muſt not only not hinder, but earneſtlie deſire theſe breathings of the Spirit, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>ult. Awake, O North winde, and blow, O South winde, upon my garden, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof may flow forth;</hi> for if the fire bee blown, the ſparks will ariſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Much frequent the company of Gods people, for their companie will much inflame; green wood will burne, when it is mixt with that which is very dry; and if thou canſt get thy heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, love will dictate and furniſh thee with thoughts enough; but I muſt give ſome few cautions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this expreſſion of ejaculatorie prayers, I meane all manner of holy thoughts, whether they are praiſes of God, or prayers to God; whether they bee any admirings; as, <hi>Lord, what is man that thou regardeſt him?</hi> or any abaſing thoughts of our ſelves, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73.22. <hi>how fooliſh was I, and ignorant, &amp;c.</hi> or whether
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170460:113"/>by enquiries after God; as, <hi>when ſhall I come and appear before God? Pſalm</hi> 42.2. or with our own ſoul, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? Pſalm</hi> 42.5, 6. ſo that I uſe the word (Ejaculatorie prayers) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comprehenſively.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let thy ejaculatorie prayers bee fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, but not cuſtomary; for as I have already ſaid, ſuch kinde of cuſtomarie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculations, whoſoever uſeth them, is neer of kin to a common ſwearer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though they bee ſhort, let them bee fervent.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let them generally bee mental, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou art alone, and if they bee vocal, bee rather paſſive than active in them: As <hi>David</hi> held his tongue, until the fire burnt, and hee could hold in no longer, but burſt out in this expreſſion, <hi>Lord, let mee know my end, and the meaſure of my daies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. You muſt not leave off ſolemn du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and think to ſupply the want thereof by ejaculatory prayers, for they are not to juſtle out, but help one another: This is, as if the Prieſts ſhould content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with keeping the fire burning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on the Altar, and neglect their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170460:114"/>morning and evening Sacrifice: And as when <hi>Solomon</hi> firſt offered Sacrifice at the Dedication of the Temple, there came down fire from heaven to conſume it; but afterwards, they were to keep in the fire day and night, by continual ſupplies of fewer: So that if they let the fire go out, they were not to expect that God ſhould by fire from heaven conſume their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as oft as they were to offer them: So it is with every ſoul that belongs to God, at firſt God doth inflame the ſoul with fire from heaven, but when once God hath kindled that fire, wee are to keep it in by continual ejaculatorie pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for elſe how can wee expect that God will alwayes kindle it anew, when wee go to our ſolemn duties?</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>The next great help &amp; direction for attaining of Holineſs, is, reading of holy books.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe next direction and advice, is, to read holy books the chief and fountain of all the reſt is the Scripture, which is able to make us wiſe unto Salvation. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it doth amaze mee, to think, that any one that dare own the name of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſhould forbid the people of God to read the Bible; but when I conſider that Popery is upheld by cruelty, and policy, and that it is unpoſſible but that their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſhould bee detected; if their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance were diſpelled, then no marvell they ſhould forbid the reading of the Scripture; but becauſe there is ſo much fear, that their errours will bee ſpread, I ſhall ſpeak a word or two to this point.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What reaſon imaginable is it, that they to whom the Scripture is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee read, ſhould bee forbidden to read the Scripture; but the Scripture is commanded to bee read, even to men, women, and children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11, 12.</p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:170460:115"/>
                  <p n="2">2. How ſenſleſs is it to ſay, I write, and ſend a letter to ſuch a man, but I intend not that hee ſhould read it? Now it is plain, that generally the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and others, were writ to all the Saints in that City, to which the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Epiſtles are directed, as appears by the titles of the ſeveral Epiſtles: And for any one to ſay, that <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they ſhould read them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ſent them to them, is ſo ſenſleſs, that the very naming of it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient confutation: But if any one deſires further ſatisfaction in a thing ſo evident, let them read the ſtrict command of the Apoſtle, that they ſhould read it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.27. <hi>I charge you by the Lord, that this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle hee read unto all the holy brethren:</hi> And in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſians,</hi> hee commands them, not only to read the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles writ unto them, but the Epiſtle writ to <hi>Laodicea</hi> alſo, and that thoſe of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi> ſhould read the Epiſtle writ to <hi>Coloſs, Coloſians</hi> 4.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe that have been frequent in ſearching the Scripture, and thereby to judge of the Doctrine that was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, by St. <hi>Paul</hi> were commended,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170460:115"/>then it is a commendable thing to read the Scripture, except one can ſearch the Scripture, without reading of it: Now it is plain the <hi>Bereans</hi> were highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for this very thing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Saviour doth command the Jewes to ſearch the Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>Paul</hi> commends <hi>Timothy</hi> for learning the Scriptures, from a childe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. &amp; 15. and hee is bleſſed, that reads, and that meditates in it, day and night, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But they ſay, Alas! how can poor ſimple people underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. 1. Ask God that queſtion, who commands them to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as hath been ſhewn already.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. One main end of writing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is, for their ſakes that are ſimple, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.7. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.130.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The way that they would have ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people take, is far more intricate, for they would have them believe the Church, but the marks whereby the Church is to bee known, as Antiquity, viſibility, &amp;c. one cannot know, except one reads over the Fathers, Centuries, &amp;c.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170460:116"/>which requires more time and learning a thouſand-fold, than that which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend is too difficult for them, <hi>viz.</hi> reading the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>They take away the Scriptures, which is the Word of Truth, and give them i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, which they call Lay-mens books, which God himſelf faith, are Teachers of lies; and for their ſaying, that hence all our errours and hereſies come, that every one is ſuffered to read the Scripture, they ſpeak contrary to that of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. And for this reaſon, learned men ſhould rather bee forbidden to read the Scripture, than others, ſince generally all Hereticks have been learned men; dare they blaſpheme God, and ſay, (as they muſt, if this were true) <hi>Lord, thou haſt commanded us to read the Scriptures;</hi> and haſt ſaid, <hi>that they are able to make us wiſe to Salvation;</hi> and that the cauſe of errour, is the ignorance of the Scripture, yet we finde, that it is the cauſe of all errours and hereſies; and therefore, though thou haſt ſtrictly commanded it, wee do as ſtrictly forbid it. But I muſt crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that I mix any thing of controverſie, in a Treatiſe that I intended to bee pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170460:116"/>devotionary; therefore I muſt crave pardon alſo, that I have handled this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, rather in a popular, than Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical way, ſince my main end of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this Treatiſe, is, not for the wiſe and prudent, but for babes, in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſenſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. therefore I ſhall now return to my former way of more practical matter, and ſhall ſet down ſome ſpiritual directions for reading the Word of God with profit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Directions how to read the Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. REad it as the word of God, there is abundance in this very directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if wee conſider the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Attributes of God, they would all inflame us with fervent deſires to read it, and infallible demonſtrations to believe it, and ſtrong endeavours to obey it; and indeed would inable us in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, to read it, as wee ought to read it; for did we believe it to bee the Word of God, as <hi>John</hi> his <hi>Revelation,</hi> or <hi>Daniel</hi> his, wee ſhould doubtleſs read it according to theſe ſeveral following directions: For though it is true, <hi>Daniel,</hi> and other of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170460:117"/>Prophets and Apoſtles; were more ſure, that their Revelations were the Word of God, than wee are, that the Scripture is, yet not then they were, that the Scripture was, and is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18. and indeed wee ought to take heed, that is, read, mark, and conſider it, until the Spirit of Chriſt ſhall ariſe in our hearts, and make us as certain of the divine truth of it, as they were; therefore the firſt great thing is, to confirm our ſelves of this truth, that the Scripture is the Word of God: But this caution I muſt give, that wee muſt take heed to go about this work, meerly by the ſtrength of humane reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out craving the aſſiſtance and light of the Spirit of God, not but that there are ſuch invincible arguments and demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that except one bee reſolved to finde out cavils, wee cannot but yeeld to this truth; yet God is ſuch an enemy to the pride of humane reaſon, that God doth hide his truths from thoſe that come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them with a carnal eye, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the ſecond direction is, to read the Word of God prayingly, and thou art to pray, not only that God would
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170460:117"/>convince thee, that this is his Word, but that thou mayeſt read it with theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral following qualifications.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou art to read it reverently, not as other books, not as books of Phyloſophy and Hiſtory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there ought to bee upon thy Spirit, the awe and fear of God; I do not mean, that this reverence that I ſpeak of, ſhould bee ſhown to the paper on which the Word of God is printed, though theſe alſo, as the dead bodies of Saints, are not to bee uſed with diſhonour and deſpight; but this reverence is to bee ſhown to the truths, promiſes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, &amp;c. the ſenſe of the Scripture; do not account them as light and trivial things, but read them with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, as both the matter and author of the Scripture require.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Read the Scriptures attentively, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, obſerving and marking what is writ in them; as a man that is try'd for his life, diligently obſerves the witneſſes, and ſentence of the Judge, becauſe his life lieth at ſtake; ſo do thou mark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Word of God, for it is thy life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.47.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Read the Word of God underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170460:118"/>for to read, and not to underſtand, is like looking on a ſealed book; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thou readeſt mark thoſe places &amp; verſes, of whoſe truth or meaning thou doubteſt, and enquire the next opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thou haſt of ſome faithful Miniſter, and enquire the meaning of them; what paſſages thou doſt not underſtand at the firſt reading, upon further examination or enquiry, thou mayeſt underſtand it: The <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> what ſhee did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, but wonder at, when ſhee firſt heard, ſhee laid up, and pondered in her heart, that ſhee might afterward under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: So the viſion that was ſhown to <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10. though hee underſtood not what it meant at the preſent, yet hee did ſeriouſly conſider what God meant by it. It were an excellent work, if there were a clear Comment upon the Bible, that might only fill up an ordinary mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and yet explain the Text ſo fully, that wee might have a competent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it: I commend the Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, commonly called, <hi>The Aſſemblies Annotations on the Bible. Dixon,</hi> and <hi>Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſon,</hi> what they have done this way, and thoſe that ſhall think it too great a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170460:118"/>to read the Scripture over with theſe Comments, may make uſe of them only, for the underſtanding of thoſe places that are difficult to them; but it is a great pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſhame, that ſeveral of the Gentry ſpend their time, either in vain and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful recreations, or in ſuch ſtudies, as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, Mathematicks, &amp;c. and let the Bible lie by, as a book not worthy to bee underſtood by them, eſpecially ſince they profeſs themſelves to bee Chriſtians, and confeſs, that it is the Word of God: As if a Lawyer by profeſſion, ſhould ſpend his whole time in other ſtudies, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing, or very little of the Laws of the Land: People generally think, that it belongs onely to a Miniſter, as a Miniſter, to ſtudy and underſtand the Scripture; but it generally proceeds from their undervaluing of the myſteries, and their diſtaſting the holineſs of its commands.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You are to read it believingly; for when once you underſtand it, the next thing is to believe, which is not ſo in any other writing in the world; for what book ſoever you read, or Miniſter you hear, when you do underſtand what they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170460:119"/>mean, you are to examine whether it be a truth or no which they teach; but as for the Scripture, you are not to ſay, <hi>How can this be?</hi> but whether this bee the meaning of the words, for the ſenſe of the Scripture, when once known, is not to bee examined any further, ſince there is no truth more evident, by which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, it being taken for the Word of God, can bee tryed; for ſince it is Gods Word, it is as true as that God is true, for ſince truth is eſſential unto God; it is all one to deny that God is true, as to deny that God is; as ſince roundneſs is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to a circle, it is all one to ſay, it is not round, as to ſay, it is not a circle.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Wee are to read it applyingly: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed divers commands were perſonal, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are in reſpect of their Office, as to Miniſters, Magiſtrates, divers were typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, thoſe that were perſonal, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his Son, ſo, is not to bee applyed to any other, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the equivalency of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould bee ſo dear unto us; but though in caſe God do require it, wee ſhould bee willing to part with it: As for thoſe commands that are typical, they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170460:119"/>are ceaſed; thoſe that belong to any one, as having ſuch an Office, are not to bee applied to any, but of that office; but as for the promiſes, wee muſt not think, that they were made to thoſe to whom they were made, becauſe they were ſuch or ſuch, but becauſe they were ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>viz.</hi> the promiſes were not made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as believing <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that promiſe which was made perſonally to him, and confirmed with an oath, was not made, or confirmed by an oath, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have ſtrong conſolation only, but that all the heirs of promiſe ſhould have ſtrong conſolation alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.14, 17. compared together.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thou muſt read it frequently: But becauſe I have ſpoken more largely in that little Treatiſe, <hi>viz. Directions to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Perfection.</hi> I ſhall proceed to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, what other books I would adviſe you to read.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THere are many rare ſpiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that are to bee gain'd by our communion with Saints, by conferences and combinations with them, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, gifts, graces, &amp;c. of which I ſhall ſpeak in order.</p>
                  <p>Now conferences are either occaſional, or ſolemn: As for occaſional conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I ſhall ſay little, onely I ſhall adviſe, that you ſhould improve your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with every Saint, according to your intimacy with them, mark what grace they are moſt eminent in; as ſuppoſe it bee humility, obſerve their carriage eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to that grace, for their example
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170460:123"/>will bee much more eminent in that, than in other graces; ſo that from their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, you will underſtand that which I have ſpoke of in the beginning of this Treatiſe, wherein the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts, as to humility: If their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency lies in their ability to confute er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, then enquire of them what are the beſt arguments againſt ſuch and ſuch an errour, if they are moſt able for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of ſpiritual doubts, or caſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, direct your diſcourſe that way; as Scholars uſe to diſcourſe with other Scholars of that wherein they are moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent. But I ſhall eſpecially treat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſolemn and ſet conferences, and thoſe may bee mannaged ſeveral wayes to much advantage, ſome of them I ſhall mention.</p>
                  <p>The firſt way is, for a number of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and experienced Saints to meet 1. at a prefixt hour, for elſe it will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the loſs of much time, if that be not obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let the queſtion they intend to ſpeak to, bee given the week or meeting before, for their diſcourſes will bee much more mature, ſolid, and deliberate.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:170460:124"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Let every one ſpeak to the queſtion ſuccinctly, pertinently, orderly, and when all the reſt have ſpoken, let the Miniſter (for I judge it convenient hee ſhould bee one) give his judgement and reſolution of the point: This hath been one way that I have known of mannaging Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conferences; another hath been this, ſome ſelect, experienced, prudent Saints, of a long ſtanding met together, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with a ſhort, but fervent prayer, for a bleſſing upon their conference; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their conferences was only ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al experiences, <hi>viz.</hi> every one told the manner and method of their converſion, which took up ſeveral meetings, they communicated their anſwers of prayers, thoſe that have been in deſertions, if they remember how they fell into them, what their doubts were, and how reſolv'd, and how afterwards they were delivered; at other times to communicate their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as to joyes, and as to the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and diſcoveries that God made of himſelf unto them, what promiſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of Scripture, was the golden pipe, that conveyed theſe cordials to them, for the Spouſe deſires to bee kiſt with the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170460:124"/>kiſſes of his mouth, for joyes that ſpring not from the Word of God, are to bee ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. They told alſo, what were the effects of thoſe joyes.</p>
                  <p>Another ſubject of their diſcourſe was, to tell what they knew of other Saints, and their experiences concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer matters. Another was, to tell what their life and converſation was, and the rules they walked by, as to eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſleeping, &amp;c. At another time they have brought forth the chief places of Scripture, which they have written down, wherein they have found moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, moſt ſupport, beſt directions in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning their converſation, or thoſe that they accounted moſt eminent upon any ſpiritual account, eſpecially in thoſe caſes for which it is hard to finde out pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture to direct us in: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, What example? what place of Scripture have you to prove, that the thoughts that Chriſt had of his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, makes him more ready to give an example of love and humility to his people, methinks that is a ſingular place, <hi>John</hi> 13.3, 4. that Jeſus knowing that the Father had given all things into his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170460:125"/>hands, and that hee was come from God, and went to God; hee riſeth from Supper, &amp;c. What place doth ſet forth the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellencie of God moſt, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 9.5. <hi>Bleſſed bee thy glorious Name, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all bleſsing, and above all praiſe:</hi> And ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the Gods?

                  </p>
                  <p>And when all was done, one repeated the ſubſtance of what was ſpoke; and this they did, one by one, in their courſe, one, one day, and another the next. Another way was this, divers Chriſtians being met together, and the ſubject being propoſed the meeting before, every one brought their anſwers in writing, confining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to half a quarter of a ſheet of paper, which papers (that no one might know whoſe papers they were that were to bee read) were put into a book by them that writ them that whatſoever was amiſs in any paper, they that own'd it, might not have the ſhame of their errour or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it not being known whoſe it was, then all the papers being read, what was amiſs, was corrected, and what was
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170460:125"/>wanting, was added, what was doubted of, was reſolved by the Miniſters that were preſent; when all was done, the papers were committed to one, who wrote all of them into a book, where they did not ſpeak the ſame thing, which was read the next meeting, before the queſtion that was then to bee diſcuſt, was ſpoke to. The queſtions were all practical and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary, controverſies being forbidden, as being more ſubject to engender ſtrife, ſuch as theſe: what are to bee accounted vain thoughts? how to bee ſuppreſt? what are to bee accounted idle words? and what means wee muſt uſe to avoid them? how far, and in what caſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to guide us, and when not? how wee are to conceive of God in our prayers? whether wee are in every particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, actually to minde and intend the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God? what it is to live by Faith? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another way is this, ſome ſelect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians agree to read ſuch a Chapter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next meeting, and give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what things they take ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in it: At another time they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that each of them ſhall read ſome
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170460:126"/>ſmall part of a ſeveral devotionary book, and give an account of the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things in it: Another time they were injoyn'd, that every one of them ſhould before the next meeting, chuſe out ſome of their acquaintance that were wicked, and ſhould ſet to the work with all their might, by prayer and conference with him, with all meekneſſe, and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to convert him, and to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how far they had proceeded, and to receive inſtructions how to proceed further; but the names of the perſons with whom they thus dealt, were to bee conceal'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you ſeveral inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but have omitted many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials, which are to bee left to, and varied by Chriſtian prudence: I have been willing to particularize that (if it might bee). I may bee helpful to thoſe that ſhall bee willing to uſe this excellent help of Chriſtian ſet conferences, and I doubt not but God will aſſiſt thoſe that ſhall deſire to improve them, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of other ſubjects for their diſcourſe; for if wee will poure out, God will poure in.</p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:170460:126"/>

                  <p>THe next great advantage that wee get from our acquaintance with Chriſtians (though wee cannot enjoy theſe ſolemn conferences with them) is, in reference to temptations, and four
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170460:127"/>advantages wee may gain, as to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee may know how to judge of our ſelves under temptations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee may learn the cure of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How to improve them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How to diſcover divers things to bee temptations, which otherwiſe wee ſhould take to bee motions of the holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the judging of our condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temptations, for weak Chriſtians that are not acquainted with the Wiles of Satan, nor know how active and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful their own hearts are in evil, think, that if they are much tempted, they are none of Gods children; nay, if they are much afflicted, they have no intereſt in God, and that they have no faith, if troubled with doubtings. There are very few, but (when they were firſt troubled with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thoughts) have been fill'd with ſuch horrour, that they have judg'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Reprobates, becauſe theſe thoughts have been injected by Satan, for they have laid them wholly to their own charge, and ſo have even ſunk under the burthen and guilt of them; but when once they come to bee acquainted with the Saints,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170460:127"/>they will finde that it is the ſpot of Gods people: And in many other kindes of temptations, they will finde, that as face anſwereth face in a glaſs, ſo heart anſwers heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the cure of temptations: As for example, theſe blaſphemous thoughts, they will tell them what they do in this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe temptations have more horrour in them than guilt, and it is Satans ſin, and not theirs, ſince they abhor ſuch thoughts, as they do he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l; as a chaſte woman that's raviſht, it is look'd upon as her affliction, and not her crime, and that they uſe (when blaſphemous thoughts aſſault them) to do as a chaſte matron doth, when a baſe wretch ſpeaks filthy things to her, ſhee will take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his words, as neer as ſhee can, and get her out of his company; ſo divert thy thoughts, and think not over thoſe thoughts again, though to abhor them; and many other ſuch directions they will give thee from their own experience; that poor ſoul is in a ſad condition, that hath no Chriſtian acquaintance to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate its doubts and temptations to, but thoſe that have Chriſtian friends to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170460:128"/>communicate with, as thoſe that have chearful company and diſcourſe in their journey, that know the way, their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to heaven will bee with far fewer mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, fears, and far more delightful.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By our Chriſtian acquaintance, wee ſhall learn how to improve temptations, and how to bee gainers by them. As for example, we may bee gainers by blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thoughts, for one way of cure is, the way to get advantage by them, <hi>viz.</hi> when Satan caſts in theſe blaſphemous thoughts into thee, do as they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.34. when they thought that <hi>Alexander</hi> would ſpeak againſt <hi>Diana,</hi> they cried out for the ſpace of two hours, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the Epheſians;</hi> ſo when Satan blaſphemes God, by caſting in theſe blaſphemous thoughts (for it is Satan that blaſphemes God, and not thou) break forth in the praiſes of God, and read, or ſing; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.116, 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, 148. or ſome other <hi>Pſalm</hi> that is filled with the praiſes of God; and as if <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſpoken againſt <hi>Diana,</hi> that general out-cry would have kept him from being heard, ſo ſhalt thou by this means drownd the noyſe of theſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and bee a gainer by them, ſince thy
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170460:128"/>praiſes of God ſhall bee far more than thoſe blaſphemous thoughts amount to, and have more holineſs in them, than they have guilt, as to thee, and when Satan ſees, hee is a loſer by his temptations, hee will bee weary of tempting of thee. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member there is a ſtory of one that made an advantage of a temptation that aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, a poor man ask'd an almes of him, and hee gave him ſomething, but his heart grudging that hee had given ſo much, hee called the poor man, and gave him as much more: I will teach thee, ſaith hee to his heart, to bee ſo wicked, and hee took an holy revenge of himſelf and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By our acquaintance with Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wee ſhall bee able to diſcover divers things to bee temptations, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wee ſhould have thought to bee the motions of Gods Spirit: As for example, as I have written in another Treatiſe, the making of perpetual vowes and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for abſtaining from things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in themſelves, though at that time, when they made thoſe vowes, they were ſnares to them; and ſo there are ſome that are put upon prayer, and hearing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170460:129"/>Sermons ſo often, that they neglect their particular calling; ſo divers in deſertion, think that they ought not to go to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, nor perform holy duties, nor that any one ſhould pray with them, for they ſay, it doth but encreaſe their guilt, and that they have mercies enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to anſwer for: Divers things wherein ſome place Religion, are but ſuperſtition, ſo that many things bee diſcover'd to bee ſins by our acquaintance with the people of God, which wee ſhould have thought to bee duties.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Another great advantage that wee receive from our acquaintance with the people of God, is, in reference to their prayers.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe next great advantage which we receive from our communion with Saints, is, in reſpect of prayer, and that ſeveral wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of their gift of Prayer, it is a good advice to thoſe that come com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to one, that they cannot pray,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170460:129"/>they will tell you, when they go to pray; they have no faith, no words, they cannot ſpeak, but when they look upon God and their ſins, they are overwhelm'd with ſorrow, they cannot mourn for their ſins, nor praiſe God for his mercies, nor love him for his goodneſs, I ſay, it is a good advice to bid them go and make the ſame complaints, in the ſame words to God, as they do to man, and it is a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and it is a good and true comfort to tell them, that ſighs and groanes without words, is better than words without them; and that God hears the deſires of the poor, before they ſpeak them; nay, though they cannot utter them, yet notwithſtanding it is a great advantage to joyn in prayer with thoſe, that have not onely the Grace and Spirit, but the gift of ſupplication, for from their ſeveral confeſſions thou wilt know more ſins, and bee made more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of thoſe thou kneweſt, than thou waſt before, by their ſeveral petitions and ſupplications, thy deſires will bee drawn forth after many ſpiritual things, which otherwiſe thou wouldſt not have thought of to have asked of God, and as from their full and clear expreſſions, thy deſires will
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170460:130"/>bee inlarged, ſo from their graces thou wilt have great advantage, for doubtleſs it is much better to joyn with one that hath the gift and grace of praver, than with him that hath the gift only: I am ready to think, that as if the ſame Sermon were preached by two, of which one were truly holy, and the other unregenerate, though ſeemingly as holy as the other, the Sermon delivered by him that was a true Saint, would bee much more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, for converſion and edification; ſo the prayer of a righteous man, doth not only avail much for the perſons for whom, but on the perſons with whom he prayeth; and the ſweet ſavour of their precious oyntments, their graces, which are poured out in prayer, doth fill the room where they are, and work upon the hearts of them that hear them.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of that precious man Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> who lying at an Inne, and his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per coming to more than hee expected, his money falling ſhort, hee had nothing to pay the Hoſtler, who railing at him, the good man went up to his Chamber, and ſhut his door, and without the Hoſtler ſtood railing, but hee went to prayer, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170460:130"/>prayed ſo holily, ſo fervently, that the Hoſtler hearing of him, was converted, and would neither then, nor ever after, take any thing of him when hee came that way: Surely the very pronunciation and geſture, the very countenance of a holy man, have ſo much holineſs, reverence, humility &amp;c. that they will ſtrike an awe upon thoſe that hear and ſee them; their looks, tears, pronunciation, and geſtures, pray and move, even almoſt as much as their words: When a Saint hath his heart full of love, joy, and admirings of God, while hee is ſending up the praiſes of God to heaven, his countenance is like <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens,</hi> like the face of an Angel.</p>
                  <p>The next advantage from the prayer of Gods people, is, by our being the ſubject of their prayers, for all Gods people have an intereſt in the prayers of Gods people, ſo that their great comfort is, that there is no minute, either of night or day, but there's many of Gods people praying in ſome part or other of the world, ſo that there is a ſtock of prayers going for us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in one place or other; yet one great advantage that wee gain by the people of God, is, by a ſtrict combination and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170460:131"/>to pray one for another, which may bee mannaged thus; chuſe out of the holieſt, humbleſt, praying'ſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans you are acquainted withal, and if they bee acquainted alſo one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to enter into a mutual Covenant to pray one for another particularly in their cloſet once a day, and each is to give to other a note of what particulars they moſt deſire to bee prayed for, but it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that they ſhould bee confin'd to five or ſix particulars, and no more, for if the particulars ſhould bee too many, it would take up too much time of that which wee ſet apart for cloſet duties; and therefore five or ſix is as great a number as well can enter into this engagement, and it is not convenient the ingagement ſhould bee perpetual, for perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of this nature generally prove ſnares, therefore it is good that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement bee but for a moneth, and then to ceaſe, or bee renewed, as you ſhall finde convenient; and the advantages of this combination are very great; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when wee remember perſonally the prayers of Gods people that know and love us, their prayers are more effectual
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170460:131"/>than they would bee, than if wee were onely included in their prayers under the general notion of Gods people; and it ſeems very probable to mee, that many mercies that wee receive, (if I may ſo ſay, wee know not how) may come to us this way. To make my meaning more plain, take it thus, ſometimes the people of God finde great inlargement in prayer, unexpected comforts, which come as it were of a ſudden, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde that they have either taken more care for the preparing themſelves for the duty at that time, or that their prayers have been more fervent than at other times; I know this may bee from free grace, without the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thine own or others prayers; ſo alſo many times wee have ſtrange delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances from imminent dangers, and yet it may bee that day wee had beg'd preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with leſs ſervency and faith, than at other times; this is that I mean, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe if it could bee known, ſome of Gods people, or other, were at that time pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, ſo that as it was with that Noble man, <hi>John</hi> 4.52, 53. his ſervants met him, and told him, that his ſon was
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170460:132"/>recovered; and when hee had ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what time hee recovered, hee found it was the ſame houre when Jeſus ſaid, <hi>thy ſon liveth;</hi> ſo if wee could by enquiring ſearch it out, wee ſhould finde that our inlargements, comforts, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, were at the ſame time, when ſuch and ſuch a Saint was praying for us.</p>
                  <p>Another great advantage that we have from the prayers of Gods people, is, to know thoſe ſignal anſwers that God hath given to their prayers; for though the anſwers that God gives to our own pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, take the greateſt impreſſion, and do moſt ſtrengthen our faith, and are the ſtrongeſt motives for the enlarging of our love and prayers, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 116.1, 2. <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe hee hath heard my voice, and my ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe hee hath inclined his ear unto mee, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live;</hi> yet the anſwers that God gives to the prayers of others, is of very great advantage, and it may bee greater than the anſwers of our own, conſidering that they are much more numerous: I grant, that the promiſes of God made to prayer, is the rock and the ſtrong founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170460:132"/>upon which our hope is built, but when wee find that God hath performed and made good his promiſes by ſo many inſtances and experiences of our own and others, it doth very much ſtrengthen our Faith; therefore ſo many experiences of the people of God in reference to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of their Prayers, are mentioned in Scripture, as <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and <hi>Eliaſers, Gen.</hi> 24. and <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 25.21. and <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. what need I tell you the anſwers, given to the prayers of <hi>Moſes, Hannah, Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. I ſuppoſe there is ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bleſſing a Saint praies for but he hath, or hath, but hee praies for; <hi>David</hi> hath recorded many experiences of others, as you may ſee <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34.6. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22.5. &amp; 107.6. and 13, &amp;c. and for his own experiences, they are too many to ſet down; But I ſhall take leave to communicate ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent anſwers of Prayers, which I have had from perſons of great piety and prudence.</p>
                  <p>The Lady <hi>Herrick,</hi> whoſe acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I do juſtly account as a great mercy of God, for ſhee was a Lady of eminent holineſs, and one that ſpent ſo much time (I think) in cloſet and other duties, that there are few if any Chriſtians go beyond
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170460:133"/>her, among other conferences with her, ſhee told mee two ſingular anſwers of Prayer, which ſhee received from God, one was this; In the time of theſe late warres, a neighbour Chriſtian friend ſent her word, that the Kings party had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to come ſpeedily to take her Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhee went up to prayer, and finding her faith ſtrong, and her hope not at all failing, ſhee thanks the meſſenger, and cold him that ſhe did not think as yet to remove; There came a ſecond meſſenger from another friend, with the ſame meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſhee retired her ſelf again into her Cloſet to prayer, and finding her confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence continue, ſhee reſolved to continue alſo in her houſe, for ſhee had formerly deſired of God, that he would not keep up her confidence of being preſerved, when ſhee was in real and eminent danger: The third Meſſenger came from Juſtice <hi>Babington,</hi> with a new alarm of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger, ſhee went to prayer again, and her confidence beganne to abate, and the more ſhee prayed, the more it abated: and ſhee taking this as a ſign, that God would have her depart, haſted out of her houſe, and immediately came the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170460:133"/>and ſearched for her with Candles and Lanthorns in every place, in and about her houſe. Another time ſhee told mee a Friend of hers came, and deſired her to ſeek God in reference to marriage which he then intended, that God would be pleaſed to further it, if it would prove a bleſſing, otherwiſe to hinder it: ſhe promiſed him (as her manner was) that as God ſhould immind and inable her, ſhee ſhould do, for ſhee was very wary in her promiſing, to pray for any, her friend came twice to know what anſwer ſhee had from God of her prayer, and what ſhe would adviſe him to do, ſhe anſwered him both times, that ſhe much feared that the match would prove very unhappy; whether ſhee judged that it would prove ſo, becauſe ſhee found her heart without life, and enlargement when ſhee came to pray as to that particular, or what other way ſhee judged of Gods manifeſting his mind as to that, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not whether I askt her or no: but ſhee not poſitively forbidding him to go on, it ſeems ſhee having no very clear warrant ſo to do, hee proceeded, deſiring her ſtill to continue her prayers, and it was ſo, that as they were going to Church to bee
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170460:134"/>married, hee was fully and clearly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of her very unchaſt converſation, and ſo was delivered out of this ſnare.</p>
                  <p>I am willing alſo to relate a ſtory that much affected mee when I heard it, and it is of a ſingal manifeſtation that God gave of himſelf to a little Child, which I ſet down amongſt Gods anſwers of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, becauſe this child was ſo eminent that way, and it was thus;</p>
                  <p>A Child of a Chriſtian Gentlewoman, was ſo given to prayer from its infancy, that before it could well ſpeak, it would uſe to get alone and go to prayer, and as it grew, it was more frequent in prayer, and retiring of it ſelf from company, and would ask of his Mother very ſtrange que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; farre above the capacity of one of his years, in ſo much that the mother thought that the child had heard thoſe queſtions ſpoke of by others, and much lik't it that the child ſhould take notice of ſuch things, and bee able to underſtand them ſo farre as to remember them, but at laſt when the child was but five years old, and whipping of his top, of a ſudden hee flung away his ſcourge ſtick and top, and ranne to his mother, and with great
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170460:134"/>joy, ſaid unto her, mother, I muſt go to God, will you go with mee? ſhee anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my dear Child, how doſt thou know thou ſhalt go to God? hee anſwered, God hath told mee ſo, for I love God, and God loves mee; Mother, will you go with mee? Shee anſwered, Dear Child, I muſt go when God pleaſeth, but why wilt not thou ſtay with mee? The Child Anſwered, I will not ſtay, I muſt go to God; and the Child did live about a month after, but never cared for play more, and then fell ſick, alwaies ſpeaking, that hee muſt go to God; and dyed of that ſickneſſe: <hi>Bleſſed be God, that out of the mouths of babes, and ſucklings, he hath perfected praiſe, Mat.</hi> 21.16.</p>
                  <p>One who had a brother, that ſpent his time in Hawking, and given to drinking and ſwearing, going one Saturday out of Town to a Hawking match, his brother being much afflicted to ſee his carriage, and how little hee minded the things of God, ſet apart that Saturday for faſting and prayer, to ſeek God for the converſion of his brother, who came home next munday a much reformed man, in ſo much that hee frequently afterwards kept daies of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170460:135"/>by himſelf alone, and gave evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tokens of his converſion, and lived and dyed (I verily beleeve) a child of God, I knew both the Brothers very well.</p>
                  <p>A Chriſtian Gentlewoman of mine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance being very dangerouſly ſick, ſent to a Chriſtian Friend of hers about twelve miles off, deſiring to ſee her before ſhee dyed, ſending her word that ſhee was afraid ſhee would come too late; ſhe went up to prayer, deſiring of God, that in caſe ſhee might come time enough to do any Chriſtian ſervice to her friend, hee would encline the heart of her husband to bee willing to let her go, for he never uſed to bee willing that ſhe ſhould go any whether from home, when ſhee came down from her prayer, her Husband met her, and told her that ſuch a friend of hers was ſick, and wiſh't her immediately to go, and did forward her exceedingly, and it pleaſed God ſhee came in time to bee a help and comfort to her Chriſtian friend, with whom I am very intimately acquainted.</p>
                  <p>About the year 1646. We kept a publike faſt in <hi>New-Sarum</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> where a woman, whom (to my knowledge) I never ſaw before nor ſince, ſent a Bil to be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170460:135"/>prayed for, largely ſetting forth how ſhee was vexed by Satan, and accordingly the bill being read, effectual prayers were made for her deliverance, from that ſore and ſtrange affliction; the next Lords day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the faſt, the ſame Woman ſent another Bill, deſiring that thanks might bee rendered to the Lord for hearing the prayers of that Congregation on the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans behalf, and for his mercy in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from the Devils power. On both thoſe daies there was a Citizen preſent, who curſed both the Miniſter and woman in his heart, ſaying, within himſelf, this is a meer juggle, a holy Siſter (forſooth) muſt bee brought in pretending to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the Devil, and then prayers muſt bee made for her deliverance, and after thanks muſt bee returned for the mercy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their prayers; and whereto doth all this tend, but to win credit to them and their prayers? But while the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen became thus a judge of unrighteous thoughts, the righteous God met with him; For immediately was the man ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by Satan, in like manner as the woman formerly had been, as hee himſelf (about a month after being weary of his
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170460:136"/>life) comming to me of his own accord, confeſſed, and after private conferences, and both publike and private prayers, hee found relief: Here was a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment turned into a bleſſing, for by this means God was pleaſed (I hope) to work a good change in him. About a year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, another Inhabitant in that City was addicted to ſome courſes diſpleaſing to God and his friends, eſpecially his wife, who deſired nothing more than his Converſion and perceiving the next Lords day, by the drift of a Text whereon the Miniſter then treated, that ſome thing might bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the next Lords day following, which would highly concern her husbands ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual condition, ſhee importunately ſought God for him, and invited him to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the next Sermon, but hee, whether hee ſuſpected any thing, or no, that ſhee had informed the Miniſter ought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that ſo hee might fit his matter to his particular, I cannot ſay: but ſo it was, when the morning of the Sabbath-day was come, hee could by no means be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to riſe out of his bed, till the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bell had ceaſed, and then ſaid hee preſumptuouſly (now will I riſe in ſpight
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170460:136"/>of any) but having raiſed himſelf half up, hee was there held, how they knew not: but ſo, as hee could not riſe up, nor lye down again, this continued for ſome time, till his wife by her earneſt prayers, obtained his releaſe: and then hee got up, and dreſſed himſelf, and made haſte to the Church, and by reaſon of ſome occaſion falling out at that very time, he came before Prayers, or Sermon began, and heard the ſubject which his Wife had deſired of God he might hear. At <hi>Ballyhaes</hi> in the County of <hi>Cavan</hi> after the Engliſh were almoſt all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, the Rebels ſtopt three Brethren, <hi>viz. Thomas North, Richard North,</hi> and <hi>William North,</hi> and becauſe they was skilful work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they ſtayed them to work for them, at length there came to the houſe where they were, a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> a Prieſt, and a Fryer, with Souldiers attending them, who told them unleſſe they would turn <hi>Roman Catholikes,</hi> they ſhould be hanged, who anſwered, we hope you will ſatisfy our Conſciences firſt about the truth of your Religion; why ſaid the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> what do you make doubt of in our religion? Sir, ſaid, <hi>Th. North,</hi> do not you affirm that ſome of you can keep the whole Law of God? yea, ſaid the Fryer ſo can I:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170460:137"/>then <hi>Tho</hi> replyed, St. <hi>John</hi> teacheth us, if any ſay he hath no ſin hee deceiveth himſelf, and there is no truth in him, whether now ſhall wee beleeve, St. <hi>John</hi> or you? in the mean time, the Prieſt found a Bible lying in the ſhop, which the Fryer took and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and perceiving it to bee an Engliſh Bible, hee tore it in peices, and uttered theſe words; This is the Book which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo many Hereticks; then ſaid <hi>Thomas North,</hi> Sir, you ſaid even now, you could keep the morral Law, but now you have broken both Law and Goſpel, which words ſo incenſed them, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Souldiers to take the ſaid <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and to pinion his armes behind him, and to carry him to the Gallowes, which they did, and when they came to the place of execution, <hi>Thomas</hi> had a cloth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, and hee deſired ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as to pray, before hee went up the Ladder, and obtained leave, hee fell upon his knees, and imagining that to be his laſt prayer, continued therein a good while, when hee had done, hee raiſed up himſelf, but heard no body about him, then hee made a ſhift to pluck the cloath from before his eyes, and ſaw no man, and ſo
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170460:137"/>came home to his brethren, who unbound his arms, and told him, that the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> Prieſt, and Fryer, had been there before him, and told them (their Brother was yet alive, and that they were beaten with lightning from the Gallowes) That was ſtrange (ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi>) that there ſhould be lightning on ſuch a fair day as this hath been, for my part, I ſaw none, neither did I minde their departure, my ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken up in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Theſe paſſages the three brethren com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming afterwards ſafe up to <hi>Dublin,</hi> all juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be true. Dr. <hi>Teate.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>ANother great advantage from our Communion with Gods people, is, from our ſerious and ſolemn engagement, to watch one over another, and faithfully to reprove whatſoever wee ſee amiſs, and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170460:138"/>whoſoever will not onely patiently, but thankfully receive reproof, is doubtleſſe farre from being an eminent Chriſtian, and thoſe that make this Covenant, are not onely to tell one another, what they ſee evident to bee amiſs, but they are alſo to tell them of their fears and jealouſies, and of the reports, yea, even of ſlanders that are ſpoken of them, for a Saint may get a great deal of good from ſlander, for generally wee do ſomething, that gives ſome occaſion to the ſlanderer to miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us, for if they report that one is a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, and a glutton, though we may be far from deſerving thoſe calumnies, yet it gives us juſt occaſion to examine our ſelves, whether wee do not take ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too much liberty in the uſe of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, and many times wee ſhould go ſo far, if ſlanders were not raiſed, that wee ſhould deſerve them.</p>
                  <p>Another great advantage from this our Communion with the Saints, is our being acquainted with all their ſpiritual experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the waies &amp; means that God uſeth with them, what places of Scripture do moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, either by way of Conſolation, or provoking and ſtirring them up to a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170460:138"/>more ſtrickt and circumſpect walking, and to a high prizing of, and longing after heaven and Chriſt, which places will either ſtir us up, and work the ſame frame of heart in us, or elſe they will much humble us, when wee conſider, the ſtrange frame of our own hearts, that thoſe places that makes others like the charets of <hi>Aminadab</hi> ſhould not move us, and thoſe places that enflame others ſhould not thaw us.</p>
                  <p>Another rare advantage that wee have with Gods people is, from thoſe high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries that God makes of himſelf to them upon their beds of languiſhing a little before they depart hence, and bee no more ſeen, and becauſe I will not tranſgreſs my own thoughts in this particular, being confident that relations of the great diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that God doth make to his people wil much affect the Chriſtian reader, therefore I ſhall relate ſome few of the eminenteſt I know. A very precious Chriſtian acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance being ſick unto death, as thoſe that were about have thought; I coming to her, ſhe ſaid, Sir, I have examined my own heart, but am not willing to truſt it, but deſire the ſeal of your Miniſtery, and that you would try and examine, if there bee any way of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170460:139"/>wickedneſſe in me: I put her to her choice, whether ſhee would diſcover her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or put mee to finde it out by queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhee choſe the former; and ſaid O ſir, God hath handled mee on his knees from my Cradle to my grave; for I hope this night, the nuptials between my Saviour and my ſoul ſhall bee conſummate; I askt her if ſhee could remember the time of her converſion; ſhee told mee that ſhee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies lived blameleſſe ſince ſhe could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; But about twenty years ago, I was at a Sermon, and the point that was ſpoke to was, that every done ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what it was that they had that they durſt own at the day of judgement; I went home and examined my graces, I found them weak, and bid them ſtand by, I durſt not own them at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I examined my duties, and found them ſinfull, and when I found nothing in my ſelf, I went out of my ſelf, unto that rock that is higher than I, and there I have been to this day. Her pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as her expreſſions being full of joy, and earneſtneſſe, I askt her whether none of her ſinnes lay upon her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and whether ſhee uſed to have ſuch
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170460:139"/>joyes; ſhee anſwered, that God had hid all her ſinnes from her for the preſent, and that ſhe formerly uſed rather to have calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than joy, but now there was a beam of light and joy came into her ſoul, but how ſhee knew not, and ſpeaking much of her deſires to bee diſſolved, I askt her why ſhee deſires to dye, ſhee anſwered that ſhee might bee rid of ſinne, and free from temptation, and have an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to praiſe her God in. A Neighbour of hers comming in to ſee her, who was a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man, ſhe left her diſcourſe with others and applyed her ſelf to him, and with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of intention of ſpirit and voice, ſhee ſaid, O Sir, ſee that you get Chriſt, and the time that you ſpend in your Garden (for hee much delighted in his Garden) ſpend on your knees, for Ile tell you, I would not looſe the joys of my dying hour, for ten thouſand worlds, ſome about her wiſht her not to ſpeak ſo loud, for ſhee would ſpend her ſelf; not ſpeak for my God, ſaid ſhee? I will ſpeak for my God as long as I am able to ſpeak, and when I can ſpeak no more, I will hold my tongue: and it was ſo by Gods good providence, that ſhee
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170460:140"/>reſting pretty well that night, the next day ſhee beganne to recover, whereupon ſhee fell a trembling every joynt, and ſhee being askt why ſhee trembled, and what became of her joyes, ſhee anſwered, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er joyes was as great as ever, but ſhee trembled to think that ſhee ſhould live to diſhonour that God that gave them: when ſhee was well recovered, I askt her what were become of her joys? ſhee anſwered mee, that ever ſince ſhee knew God, ſhee had the faith of adherence, and I hope that God would have mercy on mee; but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought it almoſt poſſible that God would ever ſhine upon ſuch a dung-hill as I am, but now I can ſay that God hath ſtampt upon my ſoul that I am his, and he is mine.</p>
                  <p>That precious Saint Mris. <hi>Drake,</hi> of whoſe life and death there is a little Book, worth the peruſing, out of which I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give you an account of her carriage, and the wonderful raptures that God gave her a little before her death: She was a woman of great temptations and deſertions for the ſpace of ten years, yet notwithſtanding the endeavours and labours of thoſe four eminent ſervants of God, B. <hi>Uſher,</hi> Doct. <hi>Preſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dod:</hi> but
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170460:140"/>at laſt growing ſickly, &amp; being free from her deſertions, ſhe became inceſſant in her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of heaven, and of the things of God night &amp; day, ſo that ſhe took little reſt, but ſpent her time and ſtrength in duties and conference, ſhee knew her end approached neer, though others lookt upon her diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rather as an indiſpoſition of body, than a fit of ſickneſſe, but ſhe being confident ſhe ſhould dye, and thereupon went to her Fathers houſe, where ſhee alwaies deſired to end her daies, and Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> comming to her, ſpending much time in prayer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and expounding the Scripture, ſhee carried her ſelf with ſuch unſatiable deſires of more, and ſuch inflamed diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the things of God, that they were all fill'd with admiration. The Lords day before her death, ſhee call'd all her children together, and with many admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and zealous inſtructions, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly diſcourſes, ſhee ſpent much time that day with them. The <hi>Tueſday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> came, and ſpent ſome time in heavenly diſcourſes, and then went to prayer, and ſuddenly as prayer was done, ſhee broke forth in a wonderful manner, in theſe expreſſions. Oh, Oh,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170460:141"/>Oh, what's this, what's this, what's this? I am undone, undone, undone, I cannot endure it; O, O, O, let mee bee gone, let mee bee gone, O, I muſt bee gone, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tarry, I cannot tarry; O what ſhall I do? what ſhall I do? O Father, O Mother, O husband, kiſs mee, kiſs mee, and let mee bee gone, come all, farewell all, let mee take you by the hand, and bee gone: Lo, lo, the Angels are come, they wait and ſtay for mee; O dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! why hold you mee? I muſt be gone, O, hee is come, hee is come, hee is come: Now, you have it, you have it, you have it, why hold you me? Iet me be gone, my work is done: O call, call, call, where is my crown: fetch me my crown, bring, bring, bring me my white robes, quickly, quickly, quickly, why runne you not? the Angells ſtay, now you have it, you have it, you have it, (meaning that now wee had the iſſue and fruits of all our prayers) O, it overcomes, overcomes, overcomes mee; I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, undone, undone, what ſhall I do? what ſhall I do? what ſhall I do? O you will not let mee be gone, with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſuch ſwift expreſſions as could not be remembred, ſhee in that ſhort time of halfe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170460:141"/>a quarter of an hour, ſpeaking more than one can treatibly ſpeak in an hour, with an extraordinary ſwiftneſſe (no ordinary action of this life) when with all ſhee heaved up ſtill all the time with fixed eyes, towards the houſe top, as though ſhee had ſeen ſome viſion, and would have flown away from them all. During which time (as wee cannot blame them) The poſture of all the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators was (except her Husband, who went weeping, and wringing his hands up and down the chamber) ſilence, wonder, and admiration; They in all their life time hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never ſeen or heard of the like: which put Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> her Husband, and all of them to a <hi>nonplus</hi> (as being beyond all experience) but if the Reader will have patience, this good creature ſhall her ſelf expound this rare riddle, yea, and Comment upon it.</p>
                  <p>This fit of ſudden, extream, raviſhing, unſupportable joy, (beyond the ſtrength of mortality to retain, or bee long capable of) being over, and ſhe laid again who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had ſtriven to have got away from them all: all being in an amazed aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſilence, ſhee her ſelf beganne thus: why are you ſilent? where is Mr. <hi>Dod?</hi> who
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170460:142"/>being neer unto her, ſate by her bed ſide, unto whom ſhee thus directed her ſpeech, Sir, what did you think of me lately in this ſtrange poſture I have been in? did not you imagine me to have been mad all the time? Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> replyed, no, but that it was very ſtrange unto them all, having never heard or ſeen the like, ſo (ſaid ſhee) ſurely it was very ſtrange, but will you know how it ſurprized mee; as this morning, ere you came to prayer, I being alone, prayed to God, that hee would not abſent himſelf for ever: but that once before my death, hee would reveal Chriſt unto mee, give mee ſome ſenſe, and feeling of his love, and open the brazen gates of this hard heart of mine that the King of glory may enter in; after which as you had prayed, this ſudden out-crying fit of unſupportable joy, and feeling, ſurprized mee with ſuch violence, ruſhing in upon mee, as I could not contain my ſelf, but make this ſudden outcry amongſt you all: but I muſt confeſs unto you I know not, neither do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I ſaid, but now I beſeech you to make this uſe hereof hereafter unto all in my caſe.</p>
                  <p>After mee never deſpair of any, how
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170460:142"/>deſperately miſerable ſoever their caſe be, which at the worſt cannot exceed mine, but uſe and apply the means unto them, and they will prevail at length; I was like a peice of knotty timber, who have endured ſo many the more knocks with ſtrong wedges, ſo much ado there was to work me. But now I thank God, who hath heard my prayer, and revealed Chriſt unto me, and now I care not for all this world, the fountain of all my miſery hath been, that I ſought for that in the Law, which I ſhould have found in the Goſpel, and for that in my ſelf, which was only to be found in Chriſt. A wrong way I confeſſe, which hath occaſioned unto me ſo much ſorrow, but now all is well, O pray, pray, pray, O give thanks, for now you have it, you have it, you have it. This ſo ſolide and ſtrange ſpeech, ſo heavenly, rationall, gave a great deal of contentment unto all preſent. Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> according unto her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, frameing himſelf unto a Prayer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of thankſgiving, admiring Gods infinite work in her, and for her, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a happy cloſe of this great work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne: for matter of Petition now ſhee cared not for, lying like a Conqueror with
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170460:143"/>an extraordinary cheerful aſpect, full of rapt joy, as now ſhee had been poſſeſſor of all things, having no need of any thing: now that Chriſt was hers, all things being hers alſo; The remainder of the day being ſpent in over-joyed ſpeeches, with exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to thankſgiving, ſtill telling us you have it, you have it, you have it, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hands in hers, and heaving them up and down many times together, very thankfull to us all, as ſhee wiſhed us to bee thankfull unto God for her.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Tueſday</hi> again, about four of the Clock in the afternoon, the Chamber being full of her Friends, joyful to ſee her ſo fraught with joy, after ſo many ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful daies. Suddenly ſhee fell out again in a ſtrange manner, in ſuch another rapt fit of joy, beyond all expreſſion, uttering juſt about the ſame things as formerly, in the ſame manner as in the morning, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about the ſame time: and ſo ceaſed, and was quiet again as formerly, ſhee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon called Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> wondering at the ſtrangeneſſe of the thing, told him, that her joy and ſenſe thereof, was ſo overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſtrong, as ſhee could not for her life contain her ſelf from burſting forth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170460:143"/>thus again, for as ſhee ſaid, her frail fleſh was overcome therewith, and ſo ſhee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him again to give thanks, hee did ſo, ſpending the remainder of that day in heavenly diſcourſes of another world, hoping that ſhee ſhould that Night have ſtept ſoundly, having now watched, and been without ſleep above a week toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but it ſeems as the lame man, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.8. having received his feet, for joy did nothing but walk, and leap, and praiſe God; ſo ſhee having been as it were in another world, revived with uncouth new joy, could not take any reſt or ſleep, but rejoyced alwaies and talked of the ſame, and ſo that Night having divers Friends to watch and ſit by her, ſhe ſpent the ſame in good diſcourſe, and ſinging of <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the time ſhee had been ill, ſhee could not of all the <hi>Pſalms</hi> endure to joyn in ſinging of the thirtieth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> but that night of her ſelf ſhe called for it, with this expreſſion, come, now turn to the thirtieth <hi>Pſalm</hi> (by the Relator alwaies urged upon her to belong to her) but I durſt never appropriate or apply the ſame
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170460:144"/>unto my ſelf until now, and ſo that <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſday</hi> night ſung the ſame cheerfully, as was ſaid, ſhee paſſing this night over alſo without an inclination to reſt or ſleep. On the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> morning, her indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent mother, that worthy ſoul Mris. <hi>Tottle</hi> did riſe betimes, and came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit her, when finding her in a ſtrange and unuſual attire, for that morning (now apprehending death at hand) ſhee had cauſed her ſelf too bee dreſſed from top to toe all in white, concealing her conceit therein untill her Mother came, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her thus ſtrangely dreſſed, ſpake lovingly to her in her accuſtomed phraſe, how now Daughter, what is the matter with thee? mee thinks thou lookeſt like a bride, ſo I am Mother, ſaid ſhee, a Bride now trimmed for Chriſt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, and now Mother, I have my laſt ſuite to make unto you (for I am a woman of another world) when I am dead, I pray you dreſs mee juſt thus as you ſee mee now, and ſo let mee be laid in my grave, for, for this cauſe, I cauſed my ſelf to bee dreſſed thus this morning, that you might ſee how I would bee laid

Soon after this, came Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> and Doct. <hi>Preſton</hi> to her, to whom ſhee with a great deal of joy, told the ſame diſcourſe as formerly ſhee had done unto her mother, that thus as ſhee was then dreſſed, ſhee deſired to bee laid in the grave; after their departure, having prayed with her, and given thanks (for no other part of prayer ſhee now affected, as being heir of all things, not having need of any thing) ſhee ſent for divers of the houſe ſeverally, unto whom ſhee gave ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſuitable exhortations, fitting unto their places, taking her leave of them all, wherein ſhee was ſo punctual, that with her good will ſhee would have had
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170460:145"/>every ſervant of the houſe to have come ſeverally unto her, but that her mother fearing that which afterwards came to paſs, ſome weakneſſe to enſue ſo much watching, ſpeaking and toyling inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of her ſpirits, durſt not expoſe her to the hazzard of ſo inſupportable a toyle; being now very much ſpent, this <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> after dinner, ſhee called to void her Chamber of every body, and ſent for her Father to ſpeak with, School, and take leave of him; whom ſhee dealt with, and ſchooled (having him all alone for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hour together, to whom when ſhee had ſpake her mind, and taken her leave of him, ſhee diſmiſſed him.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170460:145"/>that he had rather cauſe to ask forgiveneſs of her, having much failed both in duty &amp; love to her. O no, ſaid ſhe, you muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give mee, that you for ſo many years together, have ſhewed mee ſo much love, and been a means of my everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfort and happineſs, that yet I have been ſo unkind unto you, for I have not loved you, by the hundred part in that meaſure as I ought to have done; according to that love you have ſhewed to mee, but will you know the cauſe, I could love no body as I ſhould, ſo long as I was not aſſured of Gods love to mee (for that onely ſets our love on fire, to run ſtrongly the right way) I could until then, neither love you nor any body elſe, during ſo much diſtraction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as I ſhould have done, and now that my love is thus kindled, this is my ſorrow (my time being ſhort) that now I can no otherwiſe expreſs my ſelf, then by this poor acknowledgement, In a time I am ſo unfit, and diſabled to perform my deſires; but I well hope, that what I cannot do, that God that ſet you on work for my good and my other friends, will perform, when I am gone: and ſo
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170460:146"/>for that time with abundance of love and thanks, ſhee diſmiſſed the relator.</p>
                  <p>Thus having in ſome ample manner, diſpoſed of all the buſineſs ſhee ſeemed to have in this world; the remainder of this afternoon, ſhee lay in her former joyful poſture, rejoyceing to ſpeak of the beſt things unto every one neer unto her, yet without any reſt or ſleep, or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that way.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Preſton,</hi> came to viſit her, ſhee ſtill entreating to give thanks, no other diſcourſe ſhee had, as wanting nothing: ſo continuing all this day, untill the evening late, that there was a great change, as in part ſhall be ſhewed; for leaſt ſhe ſhould be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up through her former revelation, joys and rapture, ſo ſhort, which endured not ſurpaſſing her ſtrength, ſhe had a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening cooler to keep her down low: for, lo, lo, the Scene now changes again, the curtain waves, and toſſes, a little with an uncouth winde, party coloured, no firm impreſſions appeared. She who lately was in a glorious tryumph flying away for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly from us all, as it were with Eagles wings mounting upwards, is now ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170460:146"/>ſurprized with an extream fainting and weakneſſe of ſpirits, being for ten daies and nights overwearied, watched and toy led out, ſo as now ſhee bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome weakneſſe in her expreſſions, not being as formerly ſo lively and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which continued the <hi>Thurſday</hi> and <hi>Fryday</hi> after, never having any reſt or ſleep all the time, which diſtemper made them ſend poſt to <hi>London</hi> for two Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, hoping by their advice to have made her reſt, but all in vain, no phyſick could cure her, but heavenly Phyſick, therefore on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Preſton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi> kept a private faſt for her, the iſſue whereof was, in that forenoon ſhee fell aſſeep, reſted ſoundly ſome five or ſix hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then waked in a very mild and gentle temper.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170460:147"/>hold out; ſo it was, ſaid ſhee, my ſpirits were ſpent and gone, which cauſed that weakneſſe; then ſhee remembring all that paſſed, her ſtrange raptures (but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which then ſhe had ſaid in them) retaining her former grounds, comfort, and cheerfulneſſe (as in ſo much weakneſs could bee expreſſed) called for Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> and Doct. <hi>Preſton,</hi> with the reſt of her friends, cauſing them to give thanks with her and for her, venting her ſelf unto them thus, That her time was now at hand, prayed them not to leave her, and being very weak, ſpake then her minde unto her Father, Mother, and Husband, in a ſort taking leave of them, ſent for her Children and bleſſed them, now imagining to have done all her work: and ſo from thence fell into a ſilent rapture of joyfull ſinging of Hymnes, and verſes of Pſalms, not greatly caring to ſpeak unto any body ſave now and then unto Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> when hee moved an occaſion, and ſo ſhee lay this <hi>Saturday</hi> night, and the next Sunday, only when Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> came, deſiring ſtill to give thanks, all which time ſhee grew weaker and weaker, having by this time no audible, but a hollow low voice,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170460:147"/>ſearce to bee underſtood.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Munday</hi> after in the morning, when ſhee fell a ſleep, being come, Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> with the reſt comming unto her, ſhee when ſhee ſaw them all about her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced and ſmiled, taking them all by the hand with a cheerfull countenance, beckned to Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> to give thanks, and bent her ſelf what ſhee could with lifted up hands to joyn, ſpeaking ſoftly to her ſelf in her hymning way: and ſo whilſt they were at Prayer, ſuddenly her hands falling, and her lips going, ſhe ſunk down in the bed, and departed, leaving all her friends mourning about her.</p>

                  <p>THe next means for the advancement of holineſſe, is, the treaſuring up and obſerving rules for the directing us what to do in indifferent actions. As for thoſe things wherein the word of God is plain,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170460:148"/>either in commanding of them as good, or forbidding of them as evil, to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what to do in ſuch a caſe, argues ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a weak head, or a weaker heart, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want of knowledge, or want of love of God, and wee need no more in ſuch caſes, but to bee converſant in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that wee may know what God would have us to do, and in prayer, that we may do it.</p>
                  <p>But for thoſe things that in themſelves are indifferent, and the ſcripture hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined neither way, it is good to get ſome general Rules, fince we have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions in the word of God, ſome of which I ſhall endeavour to ſet down.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When thou art in doubt what to do, walk by this Rule, conſider with thy ſelf, what in thy conſcience thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt God-will allow of, and what thou ſhalt dare to own, as for the matter of it at the day of judgement; and what thou thinkeſt thou ſhalt be afraid to own then, bee afraid to do now; and conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe excuſes, and reaſons, and ſhifts (whereupon thou neglecteſt to do what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe is a duty) will have weight in them at that day; doeſt thou in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170460:148"/>think at the Day of Judgement, it will be a ſufficient excuſe for thee to ſay, ſuch a one provoked mee, and therefore I ſwore? Doſt thou think that this will be a ſufficient excuſe for thy ſin, that moſt did ſo, or that I ſhould have diſpleaſed ſuch a friend, if I had not done it? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it was ſtoried of <hi>Ignatius Jordan,</hi> whoſe Life is lately publiſht, and worth peruſal of all Chriſtians, eſpecially Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; though this ſtory be not in the book, if I miſtake not, a ſervant of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who had alwayes been a loving friend to Mr. <hi>Jordan,</hi> was drunk, and brought before him, and hee ſet him in the ſtocks ſo many hours as was directed by the Statutre; and being known whoſe ſervant hee was, by his Badge and Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> took it as a high affront to him; and therefore upon a Court day, when hee and his, &amp;c. ſat in Court, Mr. <hi>Jordan</hi> was ſent for, and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> began a long Oration, and told him how much hee had been his friend, and how that he took it as a diſgrace, and a high diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie from him, that hee ſhould ſet his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the Stocks: Mr. <hi>Jordan</hi> gravely, piouſly, and mildly anſwered; My Lord,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170460:149"/>when at the great Day of Judgement, if I had neglected my duty, it ſhall bee ſaid unto mee, I made thee a Magiſtrate to bee a terrour to evil doers, and why didſt thou bear the Sword in vain, in that thou didſt not carry thy ſelf as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil? Such a day, ſuch a one was brought before you drunk, why did you not execute the Law upon him? My Lord, Do you think it will bee a ſufficient anſwer for mee to ſay, that hee was the <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſervant, who had done mee many a courteſie, and therefore I thought it fit to bee more tender of his honour, than of thine? Do you think that God would take this anſwer: If you think hee would not, I pray bee ſatisfied, that I have judg'd it fit, rather to pleaſe God, than man.</p>
                  <p>It is related alſo in the book of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> that the Preſident of St. <hi>Julian,</hi> and other, ſent to the <hi>Angrongians,</hi> made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry for one dwelling at <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and examined him, whether hee had not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized his childe at <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had ſo done? The poor ſimple man anſwered, that hee had baptized his childe at <hi>Angrogne,</hi> becauſe baptiſme was
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170460:149"/>there adminiſtred, according to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt. Then the Preſident in great rage, commanded him in the Kings Name, to baptize his childe again, or elſe hee ſhould bee burnt: The poor man deſired the Preſident, that hee might bee ſuffered to make his prayer to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſhould make anſwer thereunto, which after hee had done in the Hall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the company there preſent, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Preſident that he would write &amp; ſign the ſame with his own hand, that he would diſcharge him before God at the Day of Judgement of the danger of that offence, if hee ſhould baptize his childe again, and that hee would take the peril upon him and his: The Preſident hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, was ſo confounded, that he ſpake not one word a long time after, then hee faid in a great fury, Away thou Villain, out of my ſight; and after that hee was never called more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond rule to guide us in indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, is, to think with thy ſelfe, what do I in my conſcience think I would wiſh I had done, when I come to die, and do likewiſe; bleſſed is the man, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of whoſe life is ſweet unto him, in the hour of his death; Where
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170460:150"/>is that man that ever repented on his death-bed, that hee had redeemed ſo much time by prayer and meditation, &amp;c. that hee had forgiven too many injuries, or given too much to the poor? I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſince the world began, whether there can bee one inſtance found of this kinde; therefore do thoſe things that thou art confident ſhall not bee a grief, nor an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of heart to thee, when thou ſhalt come to breath out thy laſt breath.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When thou ſtand'ſt in doubt of two things, which to do, and the Scale hangs even, then conſider which of theſe two the Saints would like, if they knew what thou didſt, and do likewiſe, for we should do our duties of holineſs before God with that reverence, &amp;c. as if all the world beheld us; and do what wee do in matters of the world, conſidering that God beholds us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Do that, which if thou wert to make a deſcription of a Saint, you would put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Character: As thus; Suppoſe there were a Sermon preached at ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Funeral, and the Miniſter (when he came to ſpeak of the deceaſed perſon) ſhould ſay, Shee was a woman, when
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170460:150"/>shee was dreſſing her ſelf ſo exceeding cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that shee would not have a pin nor hair awry, and shee went very rich and fashionable, would any one take this as any part of her praiſe? would they not rather think, this argued her to bee a Saint, that when shee was making of her ready, shee was ſo buſied about dreſſing of her ſoul, that shee neither cared what, nor how shee went, as to her cloaths: So if there were no place of Scripture for family duties, yet this I think will carry it to any conſidering Chriſtian, that this is not a ſpeech that agreeth with it ſelf, ſuch a man is a very holy precious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; for hee will never have any family duties, never prayed with his Wife, nor never inſtructed his family, doth not this ſpeech contradict it ſelf? So for a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who would ever think this to bee his Character? that hee was for matters of Religion like <hi>Gallio,</hi> never cared for thoſe things, ſo that men lived peaceably, as to the Commonwealth, nothing regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether they prophaned the Sabbath, or blaſphemed God, or committed never ſuch groſs idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If thou canſt finde an example of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170460:151"/>thoſe whom the Scripture canonizeth for Saints, to direct thee of that wherein thou doubteſt, and their example bee rightly circumſtantiated, and commended, that will ſerve to decide the controverſie; but if thou canſt finde no example, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what thou thinkeſt in thy conſcience ſuch a Saint would have done, had they been in thy ſtead, and eſpecially what thou thinkeſt Chriſt would have done in thy caſe; for wee having ſuch honourable thoughts of the Saints, and eſpecially of Chriſt, whatſoever our conſciences think to bee evil, wee ſhould never think they would have done, and our thinking that they would not have done it, it ſtrongly argues, that our conſciences judge it to be evil, and then by conſequence wee ſin if wee do it, for whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whatſoever thou commendeſt in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do likewiſe; whatſoever thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt, do not; for though it bee no ſure rule to judge of actions by, that that is certainly evil in it ſelf, which I condemn in another, for my condemning of it, makes it not evil in it ſelf, but makes it ſo to mee, if I do it; nay, it makes mee not
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170460:151"/>only guilty, but inexcuſable; that of the Apoſtle is clear in this caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Wherefore thou art inexcuſable, O man, that judgeſt, for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt doeſt the ſame things:</hi> It may bee, that which thou doeſt condemn him for, is no ſin, or if it bee, yet hee might not know it to bee ſo, and ſo might ſin out of ignorance; but thou art inexcuſable, for it can bee no ſin of ignorance in thee, for thy condemning it in another, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſhewes that thou thinkeſt it to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider, whether thou canſt beg a bleſſing of God upon thy endeavours in ſuch a matter, ſo that whatſoever thou dareſt not ask Gods bleſſing upon, do not do, for it will bee unſanctified to thee, ſince all things are ſanctified by the word and prayer.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is a very good way for the attaining of the perfection of Holineſs, to chuſe ſome grace from among others, wherein thou deſireſt to attain the greateſt eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and moſt to exerciſe thy ſelf in; not but that thou oughteſt to attain eminent degrees of every grace: But as Miniſters endeavour to get all manner of learning, as to bee skilful in language, Church hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, in all the Arts and Sciences, to read Phyloſophers, School Divines, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts, Commentators, &amp;c. yet generally there is one or other of theſe, wherein they endeavour after greateſt eminency; and their greateſt endeavour ſhould bee, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a clear and full underſtanding of the Word of God: And wee read of the Saints in Scripture, though they neglected the practiſe of no grace, yet they were
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170460:152"/>generally moſt eminent in ſome one; as <hi>Abraham</hi> in Faith, <hi>Moſes</hi> in Meekneſs, <hi>Job</hi> in Patience, and <hi>Elias</hi> in Zeal. Now the rules to guide thee in the choice of that grace, that thou ſhouldeſt moſt ſtrive for eminency in, are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chuſe that grace which is of moſt univerſal and ſpecial uſe, as Faith, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Meekneſs, &amp;c. for though ſome other grace ſhould bee more excellent in it ſelf, yet that which is of more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and continual uſe; will bee better in that reſpect for thee; as Patience is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent grace, but the eſpecial uſe of it is in adverſity, and in times of affliction, which are not alwayes, for in times of comforts, and abundance, there is little uſe of patience, but alwayes of humility; wee muſt bee humble in afflictions, and humble in comforts, for wee muſt rejoyce with trembling: Sugar is more excellent and ſweet than Salt, but wee have more continual need of Salt than of Sugar, and generally ſpend more of the one, than of the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chuſe that grace which is moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto thy calling: Art thou a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, a Miniſter, a Tradeſman? There
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170460:153"/>are ſeveral graces which are moſt ſuitable to theſe ſeveral imployments; diſtributive juſtice more ſuitable to a Magiſtrate; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative juſtice to a tradeſman; ſpiritual charity to a Miniſter, inſtructing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, comforting, and exhorting thoſe that are under his charge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chuſe that grace that is moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thy relations: Art thou a Virgin, Widdow, or married, a Parent, or a Childe, or a ſervant? Theſe ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations do require ſeveral graces, as an humble obedience and humility, for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and children, and thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der government, a prudent, keeping au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over children, for Parents.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider what is thy Maſter ſin, and chuſe eſpecially the contrary vertue; as if thy Maſters ſin bee covetouſneſs, practiſe liberality; if it bee pride, practiſe abjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and abaſing of thy ſelf, and humble familiarity with thy inferiours, and with the pooreſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider to what temptations thy condition of life, thy imployments, the place wherein, and the perſons with whom thou liveſt, do incline thee. <hi>Abraham</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170460:153"/>Kindred, to leave all, and wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the providence, directions, and eſpecial commands of God, was moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in the grace of Faith, which was moſt ſuitable to thoſe temptations, to which hee was moſt incident, by reaſon of that his condition of life: <hi>Moſes</hi> having to do with a ſtiff-neck'd, and perverſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who by their continual obſtinacy and rebellions, would often provoke him to anger and impatience, was moſt eminent in meekneſs. <hi>Elias</hi> living in times of ſo great idolatry, and general Apoſtacy, was moſt eminent in zeal. <hi>Solomon</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great people to judge, and hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but young, about twelve years of age) deſired eſpecially to bee eminent in wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>Now, as I ſaid before, my meaning is not, that the choice of any of theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould bee with the neglect of others, but as in embroyderies, there are divers colours and materials, purple, blue, and Scarlet, Silk, Gold, and Pearles, &amp;c. but the ground is but one; ſo this one grace which thou chuſeſt, muſt bee imbroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all other graces and duties. Now where two or three, or more of theſe rules
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170460:154"/>do concur, that grace is to bee choſe; the more rules concur in your choice of any grace, the better; if it might bee, it were beſt, that all theſe might agree in the grace that you moſt deſire to exerciſe, and excel in.</p>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170460:154"/>of the excellency, mercy, loving kindneſſe of God, and ſpeaking good of his Name, untill our hearts are wrought up to an holy admiring of him.</p>
                  <p>For in this caſe, it fares as it doth with one that is rowling a ſtone up to the top of an hill, if hee leaves off before he hath brought it to the top, and let it goe, his labour is utterly loſt, and the ſtone rowls back again as at the firſt, but if he brings it to the top, there it reſts, and returns not whence it came: ſo if when thou prayeſt, thou doeſt not bring thy ſelf to that frame of ſpirit, to which thou ſhouldeſt bee wrought, thou wilt fall back to the ſame frame and temper of ſpirit, as thou hadſt when thou didſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Pray.</p>
                  <p>It was reported of Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> as I remember, that this was his practice. And indeed I have heard of one, who at his firſt Converſion, had aſſurance, called, and ſealed the ſame day, and it was thus.</p>
                  <p>One being at a Sermon where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, ſweetneſs, and everlaſting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the love, and favour of God was ſet forth, and the Miniſter did very much preſſe every one to get aſſurance of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170460:155"/>his intereſt in Gods love; This Saint was converted by that Sermon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonderfully affected and enflamed with a deſire of knowing God to be his God, reſolved to ſet upon the duty of prayer, and reſolved not to riſe from his knees, untill hee obtained; and through his importunity and wreſtling with God, did prevail, and lived holily, and comfortably ever after.</p>
                  <p>This ſtory I commend not to others as a Preſident, nor dare I abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it in him neither, though I am much enclined ſo to do, and to judge it a raſh reſolution; but ſince the extraordinary motions of Gods ſpirit are not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or limited as well as not to bee made a rule for others, I dare not cenſure it in that particular; onely I wiſh that every one of us were more reſolute, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate in and for the things of God; and that we would not bee ſo eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, when wee beg ſpiritual mercies from the Lord, for if wee will be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God will deny us, and if we will not be denyed, God will not deny us: that which makes us generally not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, and give God no reſt, is, either
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170460:155"/>our undervaluing of the ſpirituall mercy we beg, or our hard thoughts of God, judging him not to be willing to beſtow them, both which (conſidering the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of mercy and love which God hath ſhewn us) do wonderfully provoke him, and indeed would do ſo with us, for any one deſiring ſome Jewel of ineſtimable price, if we ſhould plainly perceive he had a low and baſe eſteem of it, we ſhould up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that very account deny him, ſo alſo if a friend, one upon whom we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed abundance of favours, yet when he comes to us for ſome curteſy, we ſhould fully underſtand that he thought all our expreſſions of love to him to be but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and that notwithſtanding all our proteſtations of love, we did not mean what we profeſſed, would not this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully exaſperate us? yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are ſome caſes wherein we muſt leave off our duty before we find our Hearts wrought to that frame, wherein they are ſuitable to the matter of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: if you ſhall ask what thoſe juſt cauſes are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Miniſters praying in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſince the main of their buſineſſe,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170460:156"/>reſpects others at that time, and not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and every thing they do ought to be done as may be moſt for the edification of thoſe to whom they are ſent, therefore though as for the fervency of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they ought to act to the utmoſt, that their hearts may be brought to that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual frame which is ſuitable to the duty they perform, yet as for their continuing the duty, it ought not to be ſuch as might juſtle out other Ordinances, or hinder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers edification: as for example, if a Miniſter ſhould in his prayer before Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and in that paſſage wherein hee makes confeſſion of ſin (becauſe his heart is not wrought to an humble frame) ſhould continue ſo long that it ſhould take up all or moſt of the time allotted for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that were juſtling out one ordinance with another, and minding himſelf more than the Congregation: this alſo holds in Family duties, and in all others wherein one is a publick Miniſter, wherein we are to ſuite our ſelves for the remedying of their wants rather than our own.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As for ſecret and cloſet Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet even there alſo we are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo long, as to neglect neceſſary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170460:156"/>duties, which concern either their temporal or ſpiritual good, or any other imployment that is incumbent upon us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And leaſt this ſhould bee a ſnare to any, I do not mean that one ſinnes, if one leaves off a duty before wee have a ſenſe of that frame of heart wrought in us, that is ſuitable to the duty, for wee may have ſuch a frame of heart, and not bee ſenſible of it: So that if you deſire and endeavour to get that frame, and mourn under the ſenſe of the want of it, when after much fervency and wreſtling with God, you prevail not, God will not lay it to your charge as a ſin; nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it argues, that you have that grace that you ſo earneſtly deſire, and mourn for the want of, for fervent deſires after any grace, are either actings, or ſignes of that grace, or both.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor do I mean, that as ſoon as ones heart is in ſuch a frame, one ſhould leave off; nay, but rather should continue for a while, if juſt occaſions hinder not; nay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> indeed wee ſhould have a ſuitable frame of heart, before wee begin the duty; and that which is moſt to bee wiſht, is, that all
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170460:157"/>our duties should come from our hearts, or if that bee not, that they should go to our hearts; as thus, that wee should have a broken frame of heart, before wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin our confeſſion, and that if it might bee, that all our praiſes should be flames aſcending from a heart already kindled with the love of God.</p>
                  <p>The next great help to a godly life, is frequent examination. This frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination may bee made ſeveral wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee are to examine our ſtate and condition, as to the work of grace in us, as the Apoſtle bids us, <hi>try our ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. yet though this kinde of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination bee of ſingular uſe to awaken us, and ſtir us up to ſincerity and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in caſe wee finde our ſelves not to bee in the Faith; as alſo of more holineſs, by way of joy and thankfulneſs, in caſe we finde that wee have an intereſt in God; yet this is not that which is to bee ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as other kindes of examination; but having had aſſurance from Scripture grounds, upon due and ſtrict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee ought not eaſily to queſtion our condition, for Chriſt doth not take it well for us alwayes to bee queſtioning
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170460:157"/>his love; for as when our Saviour asked <hi>Peter</hi> three times, <hi>Simon, ſon of</hi> Jonas, <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou mee? Peter</hi> was grieved; ſo wee do but grieve the Spirit of Chriſt, when the Spirit hath witneſſed with our ſpirits, that wee are the ſons of God, and Chriſt hath manifeſted his love to us; and yet upon every ſlight occaſion wee ſay, <hi>Lord Jeſus, loveſt thou mee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond kinde of examination, as to our inward frame of heart, is, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the growth of our graces, which is profitably, at leaſt, to bee done once every year; as tradeſmen caſt up their accounts, and make up their books yearly, that they may ſee what looſers, or gainers they are at the years end; and to this purpoſe, it is profitable to keep a Diary, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mayeſt bee able to caſt up thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for it is impoſſible otherwiſe to remember the paſſages of a whole year. But indeed it is convenient, that the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the growth of our grace, ſhould bee as often as we go to the Lords Supper; for to do it daily, is very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, nor indeed can we perceive whether wee are grown or no: As when wee look upon the ſhad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w, on a Sun Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170460:158"/>except we ſtay ſome conſiderable while, though it hath moved, the diſtance is ſo ſmall, it cannot be perceived; but if wee ſtay a quarter of an hour, wee may eaſily perceive that it hath moved: So from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to Sacrament, is a conſiderable diſtance, but yearly examination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, is as long a diſtance as may bee allowed, if it bee not too much.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the main thing here intended, is, to examine our actions; and there are three particulars in that.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee muſt conſider in the morning what wee have to do that day, and what temptations are incident to our ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and imployments, and how wee may mannage all our buſineſſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, moſt for the glory of God, the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our brethren, and the ſalvation of our own ſouls: As for the conſidering how to mannage our imployments moſt prudently for our temporal lawful advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, is a duty in its ſeaſon, being rightly qualified: but it is a ſin, when thoughts of that nature ſteal away any portion of that time, which wee ſet apart for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſervice of God. By this daily
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:170460:158"/>morning pre-examination, wee may bee in a competent meaſure fore-armed, and provided for all ordinary fore-known bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But there are many actions and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that are occaſional, that one could not foreſee at any conſiderable diſtance, yet even thoſe wee ſhould pre-examine, and fore-think what wee are to do, before wee do it: And as Polititians do nothing, without conſidering how far it may bee for their intereſt, and how far not; ſo we ſhould think, when any one comes to ſpeak with us, &amp;c. what advantages Satan may get, and how far that action may bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the glory of God, and then do as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, make thy prayers to the God of heaven to direct thee to do what thou haſt to do; for if thou doeſt any thing without this examination, four great inconveniences come of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You will fall into many ſins, which you might have eaſily ſeen, and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though thou doeſt that which is right, or doeſt not fall into thoſe ſinnes that are incident to ſuch actions, yet it is little thanks to thee, no more than it is to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170460:159"/>a ſleeping Watchman, that the City is not taken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Many opportunities of doing good, pals by thee unobſerved.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For want of this watchfulneſſe and conſideration, (which is all one) or at leaſt includes examination, wee do not what wee do in the ſervice of God, with an actual intention of honouring of him, and an actual intention of honouring God, doth much add to the holineſs of the action, and Gods acceptance of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another kinde of examination, ſhould bee poſt-examination, that is, to conſider and examine our actions, diſcourſes, duties, &amp;c. after they are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for many paſſages will not ſeem to bee ſinful, or not ſo ſinful, when we look upon them before our doing of them, as they will do after; for the temptations of pleaſure, profit, &amp;c. which intice us to the committing of a ſin, do either altogether ceaſe, or very much abate of their vigour, when the ſin is committed; ſo that thou wilt by poſt-examination diſcover many ſinnes, which by pre-examination thou couldſt not.</p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:170460:159"/>
                  <p>What was one of the great cauſes of the wickedneſs of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but that no man conſidered with himſelf, and ſaid, what have I done, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. So that there bee three queſtions, What have I to do? that's pre-examination: What do I? that's co-examination; and what have I done? that's poſt-examination. The firſt is to bee performed in the morning: The ſecond, when any unforeſeen imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or buſineſs comes upon us, and the laſt to bee done at night, when wee take a review of all the paſſages of the day.</p>

                  <p>IT is evident that onely in the things of God we are negligent, in ſuch things we account that a burthen and diſgrace, which we do not ſo account in any thing elſe; nay wee pray, and wait and pay for that in the matters of the world, which in the things of God, though we bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to receive freely, we refuſe, and if forced by any Church conſtitution, wee call it impoſing and tyranny; I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſome few things.</p>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170460:160"/>travelling to ſee faſhions, &amp;c. and if in many years, they attain to exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the tongues, and arts, we think their time, and our money well beſtowed, and make much of their School-Maſters, and Tutors, and they deſerve it; and their whole time they ſpend in the attainment of theſe things; but as for the matters of God, we think wee can attain it, without any Tutor to direct us in them, without ſpending any conſiderable time, attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or money therein: as if our ſouls onely were the things that wee need not care for; or could without any help, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with piety and knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Phyſitians and Lawyers, how are their Houſes and Chambers frequented, but for Miniſters, wee think it enough, if we hear them preach without deſiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſonal directions or inſtructions in ſpiritual matters: Which are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as neceſſary and profitable for our progreſs in holineſſe, as the former are in matters of this World: And the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do preſs auricular confeſſion, and blind obedience to all the commands of their Prieſts, and ſo have mixed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that wee ought to endeavour to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170460:161"/>have from Miniſters, with ſo many ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, and ſo much will worſhip; that it hath made people neglect thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, that they may reap that way; and indeed peoples unwillingneſs to give that due honour, and ſubjection, that they owe to Miniſters, makes them ſo much decry the ſuperſtitions of Popery, that they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their own duty.</p>
                  <p>When any one goes to learn arts or Languages, hee that teacheth them, firſt, by ſpeaking with them, underſtands how farre they have proceeded, and by that is enabled to give them ſuitable directions, he directs them what leſſons and books they ſhall read, and takes a ſtrict and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent account of them, and they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exact in following their method and directions, ſo that though other books or leſſons may ſeem more pleaſing to them, yet they deny themſelves, as for Example, in Muſick, there is a method in teaching, Firſt, the plain notes, and longer time, after that, ſhorter time, and ſo giving them leſſons as they are capable of them: but thoſe that rather chuſe the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt than the beſt way, will rather learn ſome tunes they know, than to go on
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170460:161"/>methodically, and ſo never attain any perfection in the Art; ſo in <hi>Arithmetick, Mathematicks,</hi> if the directions of the Tutor bee not followed, they will finde far more difficulty and uncertainty: Doubtleſs there are many inconveniences that come for want of directions in the matters of knowledge and practiſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; ſome from open profaneneſs and ignorance, fall upon the ſtudy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes of the higheſt points of Divinity at firſt, and before they are in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure grounded in the Fundamentals of Religion, they fall upon points that are ſo knotty, that Miniſters of the greateſt abilities are not able to untye; and new beginners being received with ſuch doubtful and difficult diſputations, it is no marvel, that they turn either Athieſts, or Hereticks: It is true, that thoſe that are grounded and eſtabliſhed Chriſtians, do leſs want, but, I ſuppoſe, are more deſirous of further directions and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the matters of God: but ſurely for beginners, there is a kinde of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or great conveniency this way; for Sermons are ſomewhat too general, and cannot meet with the perſonal particular
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170460:162"/>caſes of every one, but this way will; but pride, ignorance; and profaneneſſe, makes people loath to come to the light, becauſe their deeds are evil; and Miniſters have loſt that honour and authority, that God hath, and people ought to give them, and this is the peoples loſs more than theirs; for what care we for honour, or diſhonour, if the work of God might go on as well with the one, as with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet many cautions ought to bee obſerved concerning this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As concerning the perſon whom we are to chuſe to bee our ſpiritual tutor, for great care need to be had whom we chuſe, eſpecially for grown Chriſtians, for as for others that are new beginners, thoſe that are of leſſer knowledge, and experience, and prudence, may ſerve; and by a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, I ſhall ſet down moſt of the rules that concern this matter; as thoſe that cannot ſo much as read, need not to go to School to the eminenteſt Scholars, to teach them, but thoſe of inferiour gifts will ſerve the turn; ſo thoſe that are very ignorant of the things of God, may bee inſtructed, until they make a further progreſs by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians, which that Miniſter,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170460:162"/>whom they ſhall chuſe for their Director, ſhall commend them to.</p>
                  <p>And this I would alſo have every one take ſpecial care of, what Miniſter it is whom they chuſe for their Tutor, let him bee one of good report, of great prudence, experience, and leiſure, if it may be, and one that is ready to teach and to inſtruct. Now as it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> it muſt be with Miniſters, they are to chuſe out of their Congregation, ſome that are ſo qualified, <hi>viz.</hi> prudent, experienced Chriſtians, &amp;c. to whom they are to commit the more ignorant ſort, that they might hear caſes of leſſer importance, and inſtruct Chriſtians of weaker abilities, and thoſe caſes that are of greater weight and difficulty, are to be decided by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and thoſe Elders, like Uſhers, are to fit them for the Miniſters further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of them: So that as when Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars come to a School, if the School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter findes them not to have learned ſo far, as to fit them for thoſe Formes, that are under his immediate teaching, he refers them to the teaching of his Uſher, till they bee made fit for himſelf: So a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould have divers, to whom he may
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170460:163"/>commend thoſe who have made little progreſs in the knowledge of ſpiritual truths, who may build them up, until they bee made fit for himſelfe; for if all ſhould bee under his immediate inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the burthen would be too great for him to bear, as <hi>Jethro</hi> told <hi>Moſes;</hi> and as after ſome few years pupillage, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to a Tutor at the Univerſities, Students are left to ſtudy by themſelves, and be Tutors to others; ſo private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould bee ſo long inſtructed, until they bee made fit to teach others, and then (ſave in ſome weighty caſes, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties) they need not further directions from man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is to bee cautioned, that I do not mean, that any one ſhould bee totally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the advice of the Miniſter whom they chuſe, but in any thing wherein they do but doubt of the ſinfulneſſe of it, they are to enquire of other Miniſters.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor do I intend, that in every ſlight occaſion, that they with ordinary diligence may ſatisfie themſelves in, that they ſhould go to bee reſolved of the Miniſter; as we do not uſe to go to the Phyſitian for a ſcratch with a pin, or every inconſiderable
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170460:163"/>matter, but what wee can cure our ſelves, or is of little conſequence, wee trouble them not with.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Nor do I think a Miniſter is bound to receive all that come to him upon this account, for hee is to receive no more than hee can well inſtruct, and direct this way; and ſo alſo, that hee may not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the publike offices of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That every one is rather to chuſe his own Paſtor, if hee bee rightly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, than another; and if hee ſhould not bee in reſpect of diſcretion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, &amp;c. fit to bee choſe for a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, yet wee are not therefore to leave his Miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>I know people will be ready to ſay, What, do you make children of us, to put us to ſchool?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. 1. Why do you by putting odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous termes and expreſſions upon it, make it hateful, and then diſlike it, for the termes you your ſelf have put upon it? Why may you not as well ſay? Why do you endeavour by all your prudence and induſtry to bring us to heaven? The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion may bee better askt in thoſe termes
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170460:164"/>and expreſſions, than in yours; you call good, evil, and then you hate it, becauſe you call it ſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I do not intend that all ſhould be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as children, if you call it ſo, except you are children in knowledge; and then in ſome reſpect, it is neceſſary that you ſhould bee uſed as children: If a man will go to learn to write, hee muſt learn his letters, as a childe doth; as in Muſick and all other Arts, the method is much alike to children, and men; but for thoſe who are already grounded in Religion, and are knowing Chriſtians, let them be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to teach others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Why do not you ſay thus to Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Phyſitians, when they examine you, concerning your health, or eſtates? and ſay, Why do you Catechize us, as if wee were children? It is a ſad thing, that people ſtudy wayes to make the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Miniſters odious to them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If a Phyſitian live neer you, and ſhould offer that whenſoever you, or any of your family were ſick, if you would come to him, hee would give you his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice freely; would you ſay to him, what need you trouble your ſelf with mee, or
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170460:164"/>my family, wee can look well enough to our own healths, without troubling of you?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We are far from deſiring, or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it fit, that you ſhould bee ſubject to us, as children are to their Parents or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; for wee require it at your hands, that you ſhould ſearch the Scriptures, and try, whether the things that wee preach are according to the Word of God, or no, onely let it bee done with meekneſs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and deſire that you may know the truths of God, that you may practiſe them; and therefore I will conclude all, with ſetting down ſome plain, graduall propoſitions, and conſider what is ſaid, and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All are bound to accept the tender of Miniſterial advice and inſtruction, not only publikely, but from houſe to houſe; for though ſome think it not neceſſary for a Miniſter to go to every particular perſon in the Pariſh, where God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, yet I know no one but holds it a ſin, in any one that ſhall ſlight the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate inſtructions and advice of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and refuſe to have conference with
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170460:165"/>them, when they ſhall give them a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian viſit, to ſpeak with them about the things of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is not enough for them to give the Miniſter the hearing, and neither care to remember nor practiſe his private, as well as publike ſpiritual directions, that are grounded on the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Every Chriſtian is bound in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and difficult caſes, to ſeek their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, if by their own prayers and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, they cannot bee ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That they are not lightly to reject their advice, but to obſerve, and follow it, if they do not in their conſcience think that it is in the leaſt contrary to the Word of God, nor any way prejudicial to any thing but their lazineſs, or ſome carnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I queſtion not but God hath made a difference between private Chriſtians and Miniſters, in this caſe, I mean thus, that one private Chriſtian hath not the ſame obligation to ask, or follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of another private Chriſtian, as of the Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall offer onely theſe places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for you to conſider of, which I doubt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170460:165"/>not (except there bee ſome ſtrong by as of prejudice upon your ſpirits) will eaſily prove this to you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.15.16, <hi>I beſeech you brethren,</hi> (yee know the houſe of <hi>Stephanas,</hi> that it is the firſt fruits of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi> and that they have addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Miniſtery of the Saints) <hi>that yee ſubmit your ſelves unto ſuch, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth, Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you.

                  <p>Theſe places are enough for ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and I am confident, that ſuch need not bee preſſed to come to Miniſters for advice and direction, if they may have but leave and opportunity, they deſire no more: They are ſo ſenſible of the great advantage that is to bee had this way, that they will not ſay, I pray prove it to mee, that I am bound to take a Miniſters ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, no more than a man that is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſick, will ſay, prove it to me, that
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170460:166"/>I am bound to ſend for a Phyſitian; as except you can prove it to bee a ſin, the ſick man will ſend for a Phyſitian; ſo though it could not bee proved an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute duty, if apparently it bee no ſin, an humble Saint (that deſires to uſe all profitable means for ſoul advantage) will joyfully make uſe of this.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>The eleventh help for the perfecting of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> viz. <hi>keeping of a Diary.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is certain, that it is our duty, not onely to bee affected with preſent mercies, at the very time of Gods beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, but to keep them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, for ſo <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.2. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits.</hi> Hence it is, that the Saints of old have given names to places, to their children, to continue the memory of mercies they received: So wee read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. that <hi>Samuel</hi> named the place
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170460:166"/>
                     <hi>Eben-ezar,</hi> to keep in memory an outward deliverance, ſo in reſpect of ſoul mercies, <hi>David</hi> can tell you what God hath done for his ſoul, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 66.16. So <hi>Paul</hi> can tell you of the great Raptures hee had twelve years before, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is as little doubt but we ought to remember ſins; ſo <hi>David, My ſin is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before mee, Pſalm</hi> 51.3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.7. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and forget not, how thou provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedſt the Lord thy God to wrath, in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a Chriſtians duty alſo, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when hee hath ſignally prayed for any mercy, to keep in memory that hee hath done ſo, or elſe when the mercy comes, it will neither bee ſo ſweet, (ſince he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive it as an anſwer of prayers, if hee have forgot that hee prayed for it) nor will hee bee incouraged, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Gods anſwering his prayer, to pray with more confidence afterwards, nor yet give God the glory due to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in any meaſure, as hee ought to do, ſince the giving of a mercy, as an anſwer of prayer, doth exceedingly exalt the mercy, and in ſome caſes, is greater than the mercy it ſelf, as in temporal bleſſings.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:170460:167"/>
                  <p n="4">4. It is very profitable; nay, I may ſay, it is a neceſſary duty, for every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to examine the growth of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is a duty that God commands, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.18. <hi>to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a neceſſary duty for us to keep the vowes and promiſes that wee make to God, exactly in our remembrance; nay, and indeed, except wee keep them <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> they will bee very great ſnares unto us; for to many vowes, there are many circumſtantial expreſſions and cautions to be had, of which I have largely ſpoken in my Treatiſe of Meditation, Chapter the tenth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is alſo of great advantage, to know our ſins before they come to bee cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or of any long ſtanding, to know them, when they are but a day old; which I have alſo more largely ſhown (and am not willing to repeat) in my Treatiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>(Directions for Chriſtian Perfection)</hi> in the Chapter, where the benefits and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for Diurnal examination are ſet down.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things being duly conſidered, it being without controverſie, that all
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170460:167"/>theſe fore-named duties, are neceſſary for every one that owns the name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: Now the onely queſtion is, what is the beſt expedient to help us to remember our ſins? Gods other mercies, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular his ſignal anſwers of prayers, our vowes, &amp;c. Now I am confident, there is no expedient comparable to this, viz. keeping a Diary: And whoſoever, through lazineſs, or undervaluing the performance of theſe duties above-named effectually, I ſay, if upon that account any do neglect to keep a Diary, hee high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſins againſt God, and his own ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee neglects that ſpiritual profit that hee might reap thereby. I will ſet down ſome other benefits, and motives, that may perſwade you to keep a Diary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thy very writing down all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual paſſages of the day, will much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thee, and neceſſitate you particularly to remember them, and ſo put you upon that profitable duty of Diurnal examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it is true, there is much more required to perform that duty ſolemnly, than a bare writing down what wee have done that day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In times of deſertion, it will bee of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170460:168"/>great advantage, ſince wee may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to our ſongs in the night, and to all our ſpiritual experiences, and thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſealings that God hath beſtowed on us at Sacraments, ſince all ſuch things are to bee ſet down in our Diary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Upon dayes of Humiliation, to look over our groſſer failings, nay, and Gods mercies alſo, will ſerve very much to the melting of our iron, and breaking of our ſtony hearts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is evident, that divers callings that are exact in their obſervations, do keep Diaries of all their proceedings; as Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Travellers, States men, Phyſitians, Tradeſmen, Merchants, &amp;c. and why ſhould onely Chriſtians neglect that courſe that is ſo profitable to others? What Tradeſman almoſt is there, that doth not keep an account of his expences, and his receipts; and Merchants keep ſeveral kindes of books; nay, divers of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then have obſerved this, though but in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil matters, as I could give you inſtances, if it were convenient, in this place.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt anſwer divers Queries, and divers Objections, that the way may bee made clear before you.</p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:170460:168"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quere</hi> 1. You will ask, What are the things that we muſt ſet down in a Diary?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, I have already mentioned them, though I ſhall a little more fully and particularly ſpeak of them; you are to ſet down,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The mercies of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your ſins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Your ſpecial ſignal prayers for any peculiar mercy; as ſuppoſe you have ſet a day a part on purpoſe to ſeek God, in the behalf of ſuch a relation, that walks in wayes deſtructive to his own ſoul, write down, in that day, which you ſet a part for this end, the cauſe and motive of your keeping that day, a day of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If God ſhall give you an anſwer of this, or any other like ſpecial prayer, write it down.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You are to write down every vow, and promiſe, that you make unto God, in this Diary, on that day, when you make it, and the cauſes and motives of making ſuch a vow, if you keep a larger Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You are to have ſome mark in your Diary, which you are to joyn to every
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170460:169"/>duty, whereby you may know how you perform that duty; whether with ſpecial fervency, and inlargements, or whether in ſuch a way, as nothing is remarkable, either in reſpect of excellency, or deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Wee are to ſet down in this Diary, the afflictions that God layeth on us, or ours, and our carriage under them; as when God ſmites a childe with ſickneſs, ſuch a day, and I was exceedingly impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; or through mercy, patient under it; and I examin'd what might bee the cauſe of this chaſtiſement, and I found it to bee ſuch, or ſuch a ſin, and ſet upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quere</hi> 2. What mercies, and what ſins, are to bee ſet down in the Diary? For to ſet down all, were endleſs and impoſſible, for it is in him wee live, and move, and have our being, every time wee ſpeak, breath, move &amp;c. are mercies wereceive from God; ſo alſo for our ſins of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and humane frailty, wee may ſay of them, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who knowes how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hee offends?</hi> So alſo for afflictions, we are not to ſet down every light affliction, as if a finger doth but ake a little, or if we
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170460:169"/>fall in the ſtreet without any harm, &amp;c. But I would not bee miſtaken. I do not ſay, wee are not to take notice of the lighteſt affliction, for that were to deſpiſe it, and contrary to that command, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.11. for the meaning of thoſe words, is this, that bee the affliction never ſo great, wee are not to diſpond, or faint; ſo be the affliction never ſo light, wee ought not to deſpiſe it. So for ſin, none is ſo ſmall, but you ought to endeavour againſt it, and mourn for it, yet it is not to bee ſet down in the Diary; but thoſe that are groſſer ſins, as angry words, praying without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable marking what one prayes, or reading a Chapter, without diligently obſerving what one reads: As for drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, lying, and ſuch abominations, I do not expect that perſons that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch ſinnes, ſhould keep a Diary: But under theſe groſſer ſins, I do compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend divers ſins of omiſſion, and divers ſins of thought, as any Atheiſtical thought, without reſiſting of it; for if it be meerly from Satans injection, they have divers times leſs guilt, than ſome ſins of humane frailty, ſo for ſome ſins of omiſſion; as for example, in many caſes, if thou heareſt
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:170460:170"/>one ſwear, and doeſt not reprove him, or ſeeſt one that truly wants, and doeſt not relieve him if thou canſt. So all other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of neceſſary duties, I do not mean all omiſſions in duties, but all omiſſions of duties; for whenſoever you pray, or give almes, you do omit, as to the degree of your intention, to do it to Gods glory; nor is there any act of holineſs whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, wherein wee do not more or leſs ſin; ſo then, a total omiſſion of any duty, is to bee taken notice of, or a partial omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if the duty bee of any long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and if it bee any proportionable part of the time that is omitted; as for example, in keeping the Sabbath to ſpend half an hour of it without Sabbath day thoughts; and ſo in a day of Humiliation, though to ſet down the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> what is the leaſt portion, is very difficult; but in ſuch caſes, the uprightneſs of the upright will guide them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.3. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is to bee conſidered, that the more perfect and holy any perſon is, the more progreſs hee hath made in piety; ſo hee is to take notice of his failings, for that miſcarriage which is more than uſual, is to bee taken notice of, for that will bee
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:170460:170"/>more than uſual to him, which is but uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to another; nay, that fervency, attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and feeling, which is frequent to him in holy duties, may bee eminent and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular to another, whoſe graces are much weaker; as wee take notice of divers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to queſtions, of the matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as extraordinary in a childe of five years old, which are not remarkable in a grown knowing Chriſtian: So if you ask mee what mercies wee ſhould take notice of, I anſwer, extraordinary mercies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee of extraordinary actings of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or receiving comforts in duties, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times. Further, wee are to be more particular and exact in the obſerving of our failings in our Maſter ſin; as if an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bee your Maſter ſin, take ſtrict no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of your failings that way.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome objections I ſhall anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I have not time to do this great work.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It will not take up any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, to keep a profitable Diary, ſuch an one as may bee much better than none.</p>
                  <p>I know one that writ but a line for a
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:170460:171"/>day, from which hee hath received much advantage, in which the main paſſages of his life were ſet down, as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them; for in ſuch a Diary wee muſt uſe letters for words, and particular marks for ſome ſins, which being of ſuch common uſe, wee cannot forget what they mean; as for example, P for prayer, M for meditation, R S for reading the Scripture, R alone, for reading other books, C for conference, a littler, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie our riſing, a V for a Vow. If God come in more eſpecially in acting our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or comforts in any duty, as prayer, meditation, reading, conference, &amp;c. to give this mark — over the letter that ſtands for that duty; as for example, if God comes in much in prayer, draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the P that mark, thus, P. If you have had many failings in prayer, then draw that mark under the letter, thus. P So you may do in all other duties, as meditation, conference, hearing, over or under, as are your incomes or failings in thoſe duties which that letter ſtands for.</p>
                  <p>But if there bee no eſpecial defect or
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170460:171"/>incomes of God in the duty, then let the letters ſtand without any marks, either over or under, and when you keep daies of faſting and prayer, then put before the line you ſet down for the day F, which ſignifies a Faſt day. I ſhall give an inſtance, whereby all this may bee made more plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SEPTEMBER.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>T. 1. r. 6. P. 6. 7. M. 7. 8. St. 12. C. 1. St. 5. C. 6. W. 2. r. 5. P. 5. 6. R. V</p>

                  <p>V. to keep a Diary. The meaning is this: Tueſday, being the firſt day of the moneth, I roſe at ſix of the clock, prayed with ſpecial incomes from God, half an hour; (for when 6. and 7. are ſet down, it ſignifies half an hour paſt ſix, and ſo in other figures, when two are ſet down) meditated while half an hour paſt ſeven, with ſpecial incomes from God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of actings of graces or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, (for the ſtroke over the letter ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170460:172"/>ſo much) I ſtudied while twelve of the clock, came again to my Study at one, and ſtudied while five, and confer'd about matters of God, until ſix.</p>
                  <p>Wedneſday, being the ſecond day of the moneth, I roſe at five of the clock, prayed but with much deadneſs for half an hour, for the ſtroke under ſignifies ſo much; Read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but nothing extraordinary, either for deadneſs, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of Gods Spirit; for if there bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over or under the letter, it is to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſo much; ſtudied while twelve, came again to my Study at two, Read ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votionary book while three, with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtudied while ſix, then made a Vow to keep a Diary.</p>
                  <p>The meaning and uſe of the ſtrokes in the Margent, is, that with ones eye one may quickly ſee, what vowes, what incomes or failings have been in that moneth; for at the end of every moneth, it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſet down, whether one is encreaſed, or decreaſed in holineſs, or comforts; and as when one makes any vow, one puts an V in the margent before that day; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if one hath made any ſignal prayer for any mercy, one is to put a P before that
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:170460:172"/>day, if one hath received any ſignal anſwer of prayer, put an A in the margent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that day; and if one hath received any ſignal deliverance out of ſin or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, put a D in the margent; and if you have kept a day of Faſting and Prayer, put F in the margent; and ſo in other things, common prudence will direct.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee that I have ſhown you how eaſie a thing it is to keep a Diary, and how little time it takes up; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I could wiſh you would write your Diary ſomewhat larger; as when your affections are raiſed in reading the Scripture, to ſet down the verſe which moſt affects you; ſo when you hear a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, when you come home, to write down thoſe paſſages that moſt affect you, and moſt concern you: So when you make any vow, to write down what was the eſpecial occaſion of making that vow; ſo when you finde your heart ſomewhat dead in duties, to ſet down what the cauſe was of that deadneſs, if you can finde it out, whether it was for want of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome ſin the day before, which cauſed God to withdraw himſelf: So if God comes in with any ſpecial comforts,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170460:173"/>write down that place of <hi>Scripture</hi> which was the golden pipe that convey'd them; for generally, as I have elſewhere ſaid, his comforts are the kiſſes of his mouth, that is, ſomething that the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken, ſome paſſage in the Word of God, brings our comforts. This was that which quickened <hi>David</hi> in his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.50. This is that which <hi>David</hi> did eſpecially praiſe God for, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 56.4. and 10. for this it ſeems was that which convey'd to him all his comforts: Or if God doth any other way ſatisfie thy fears and doubts, as I remember it is related in the life of <hi>Mr. Murcate,</hi> that when hee was once in great doubts of Gods love towards him, this was darred into his ſoul, with a great deal of evidence and power, <hi>If I am not thy father, am I thine enemy?</hi> And at another time, upon the like occaſion, <hi>If I am not thy father, why doeſt thou follow after mee?</hi> This is ſet down, with many other ſingular paſſages, in a Diary hee kept, which was found in his Study after his death. But for all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions, it is almoſt impoſſible to ſet them down, but either God will direct you, if you ſet to conſider what is
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:170460:173"/>to bee done in the caſe, or conſult with ſome experienced friend that keeps a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, only I ſhall add this, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes moſt Chriſtians, as Scholars may ſet St, to ſignifie ſtudying, becauſe that is the work of their particular calling; ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe particular callings are trades, or Merchandiſe, &amp;c. they may ſet down a great E, to ſignifie Employment, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The next objection is, I have not skill, I know not how to keep a Diary. For that, I think, I have already in ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaſure anſwered, by ſetting down ſeveral directions, and have alſo told you, that for other particulars that may occur, you muſt have recourſe to ſome experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtian; only I ſhall add this, that I would have you leave about four leaves at the beginning of your book you intend for a Diary, each leaf divided into five parts, thus, and thus ſuper-ſcribed.</p>

                  <p>The reaſon of doing this, which will bee very little trouble, ſince all theſe heads do ſeldome occur, is, that you may ſpeedily finde out what vowes you have made, and ſo know whether you have performed them; what prayers you have made, and whether they have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd; what extraordinary manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you have had, like that of <hi>Mr. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> or of like nature; and whether you have given ſpecial thanks and praiſe to God for them; ſo you may eaſily ſee what groſſer failings you have been guilty of, and whether you have particularly humbled your ſoul before God for them: As ſoon as ever you made any vow, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or received any deliverance, &amp;c. you are to enter the day under the reſpective
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:170460:174"/>head, and when you have performed the vow, or your prayer bee heard, or given thanks for the mercy, or particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of the ſin, you are to draw a line un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſpective day of the moneth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that head.</p>
                  <p>But you will object, by this means all my doings ſhall bee made publike to all the world when I die, which may be very ſcandalous to Religion, in ſeveral caſes, and to make ones graces and comforts known, though after death, may bee an occaſion, or act of pride, while wee live.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer: 1. If thy ſin bee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely known, thou ſhouldſt do ſomething to make thy repentance as publikely known, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. but if it bee ſecret, thou mayeſt have a ſecret mark in thy Diary, to ſignifie it, which none can know but thy ſelf; and as for Gods manifeſtations, and mercies, of that nature towards thee, as anſwers of prayers, comforts, &amp;c. thou ſhouldſt not bee too willing to conceal them, but willing to make them known to ſome of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. But if thou canſt write Short hand, all this is anſwered; or elſe, it is probable, God may give thee ſo long
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170460:175"/>time before thy death to diſpoſe of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as to give thy Diary into the hand of ſome Chriſtian friend.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2 is, Why do you preſs this as a duty, though not abſolutely neceſſary to all, yet of great ſpiritual advantage? How comes it then, that ſo many eminent Saints do not, have not kept a Diary?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. 1. Suppoſe through ignorance they have neglected this duty, will you therefore conclude, that it is unprofitable to them that know it? Eminent Saints may live all their lives in a ſin of omiſſion and commiſſion; as for inſtance, in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy, though our Saviour proves it to bee a ſin from the beginning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.5, 6. So alſo for meditation, I ſuppoſe it hath been very much neglected amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, I mean, as to the making of it a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn particular duty, and yet ſolemn meditation is of ſingular uſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How do you know what eminent Saints have done, or what they do? for ſuch things as theſe are kept ſo ſecret, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, it may bee, not to the moſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome friends.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some you ſay do not keep Diaries, and others do keep Diaries; and I ſuppoſe
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170460:175"/>I ſhall ſufficiently ſhown you the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of keeping a Diary in the practiſes of the Saints in <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Suppoſe no ſuch thing hath been done, doth that argue, that it's not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to bee done now? Printing hath not been many years, ſhall wee therefore decry it, as not expedient; ſo the Scripture hath not been long diſtinguiſhed into ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor alwayes into Chapters: Do wee rather chuſe Bibles not ſo diſtinguiſhed, and account ſuch diſtinctions and diviſions uſeleſs, doubtleſs, though as to Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wee ought not by our humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to invent any that are new, and not commanded in Scripture; yet as for the decent orderly mannaging of them, as may be moſt to edification, Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is very uſeful, and wee commend this only upon that account, not as a thing of abſolute neceſſity, but if any better way can bee found for the performance of thoſe duties mentioned in this Chapter, or a better model for keeping a Diary, as I doubt not but many may be uſe them, but in the mean time, neglect not the uſing of any, becauſe you cannot have the beſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I underſtand not this queſtion, it
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170460:176"/>is ſomewhat like a queſtion once propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to me, I preſsing one of my Pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſome years ſince, to minde holineſs, make it his buſineſs, and to ſpend one hour a day, reading and praying, &amp;c. and giving more particular directions for the daily time ſet apart for Gods ſervice, after by many evaſions and excuſes hee endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhift off this exhortation, all which, by Gods aſsiſtance, I having taken off and anſwered, hee at laſt in ſome diſcontent asked mee, why I ſhould offer to preſs him to ſpend an hour a day in the immediate ſervice of God, &amp;c. Had I preſt any of the neighbours to it, or did I ever preſs it to any other before? Why ſhould hee be the firſt that I ſhould ſpeak to? So it is for you to ask, Why ſhould I bee the firſt that ſhould keep a Diary? Though, let mee tell you, thou art not the firſt (as I ſuppoſe) of thouſands, yet becauſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the ſoundation of all matters of Piety, therefore I ſhall ſhew many places where the year, the moneth, the day of the moneth is ſet down, when ſuch and ſuch things were done, when the waters aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the tops of the mountains firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, when the Ark reſted, when the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170460:176"/>earth was quite dry, the very day when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to the people ſuch and ſuch things, the very moneth, day, and year of <hi>Solomons</hi> Reign, and from the children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is ſet down; when the Temple began to bee built, and the very day when it was finiſhed; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, and moneth, and day, when <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> came up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and when the famine began, <hi>&amp;c. Gen.</hi> 8.4, 5, 13, 14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 38. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.1, 3, 8, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.27. And as for the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> hee hath kept a perfect Diary of ſeveral times, when the Word of the Lord came unto him, and divers other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances added alſo, beſides the year, moneth, and day, as of place where, and perſons with whom hee was, as by theſe places following, plainly appears, <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.1.31.1.32.1.40.1.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould the Spirit of God write down ſo particularly the year, the moneth, and the day, ſurely it is for our inſtruction; there may bee ſome ſpiritual advantage got by knowing the very day when the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170460:177"/>Lord did beſtow ſuch or ſuch a mercy, &amp;c. then only to know that God did beſtow it on us, but not know when: This was not only the practiſe of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but of other Prophets alſo; as <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.1. 2 <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.1, 10, 20. ſo if you obſerve the book of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> there are 99. that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to <hi>David,</hi> 74. have his name pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt, 25. of them have no name prefixt, yet ſome of them, the Scripture it ſelf, entitles <hi>David</hi> to, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.7. and <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſuppoſeth the reſt of the 25. to bee his alſo: Now you ſhall finde in thoſe Pſalmes, as it were, a Diary, of the moſt remarkable paſſages of <hi>Davids</hi> life; nay, you ſhall finde in many of the Pſalmes, the very prayers and meditations that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had upon ſeveral particular occaſions, as in theſe Pſalmes following, 51.52.54.56.57.59.60. ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as by their ſeveral titles do appear. How often do you finde mention of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Gad</hi> the Seer, <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Shilonite, <hi>Jaddai, Shemmajah, Iddo, &amp;c.</hi> theſe were private Records, or Diaries, kept by them, of remarkable paſſages, that concern'd the Church of God; and that expreſſion, <hi>(is not this written in the book
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170460:177"/>of</hi> Jaſher) <hi>Joſhua</hi> 10.13. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. cannot bee meant of any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the ſame perſon could not live from <hi>Joſhua,</hi> till the time of <hi>David;</hi> but the meaning is, <hi>Is it not written in the book of the Juſt?</hi> for holy men in thoſe times, and ſince, uſed to keep Records, of the ſpecial mercies and judgements of God, as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> obſerves; and the very title of the book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> ſignifies, (the words of daies) Now it is evident, that in civil matters alſo, not only the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> did keep Diaries, (for where you read, <hi>Is it not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>and in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of</hi> Judah, thoſe are meant) but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heathen Emperours, as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> writ his own Commentary, that is Diary, ſo the word ſignifies. <hi>Tyberius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> had their <hi>Diurnos Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarios,</hi> as <hi>Gaſper Sanctius</hi> in his <hi>Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomena</hi> to the Kings, obſerves. So <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> had Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries by them continually to write down all that they did, and ſaid, and all that befel them, as <hi>Diodate</hi> upon <hi>Heſter</hi> 2.23. obſerves.</p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:170460:178"/>
                  <p>I have been a little larger in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe people think it is a new thing, and that there are no Scripture proofes at all for it, to prove it either a profitable, or an ancient practiſe among the people of God; but doubtleſs (as I have ſaid) if there were no ſpiritual advantage to be got, to know the particular times of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Scripture would never have been ſo punctual, and particularly in ſetting of them down. But to proſecute this a little further, do but conſider, that whether you keep a Diary or no, God doth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.12. and in his Diary are all your ſins, and all your good works ſet down; ſurely if it were poſſible for us to ſee it, every minute wee ſhould ſee ſomething written, either in the black Regiſter of our ſins, or in the Records of our good works; and it would ſtartle us, if an Angel ſhould be by us, and we ſhould ſee him write down every idle word, as wee ſpeak it, and tell us, this you muſt anſwer for at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would make us more watchfull; yet though wee cannot ſee this done, nor read what is written in thoſe books, yet wee may do ſomething towards it, by keeping a Diary of our own, and by
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:170460:178"/>judging and condemning our ſelves out of our own, wee may prevent our being judged and condemned out of Gods Diary; nor was <hi>David</hi> ignorant of this truth, that God doth keep ſeveral books of Records, (to ſpeak after the manner of men) ſome where our ſins are written down, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.9 for blotting out, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth writing down; and other where the members of our bodies are ſet down, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.16.</p>
                  <p>A third book that <hi>David</hi> obſerves that God keeps, is of the afflictions and tears of his people, of their ſeveral wanderings, when they are driven from place to place; and as for their tears, hee bottles them up, and writes them down, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 56.8. I ſhall conclude the anſwer to this objection with this further argument, or motive, to keep a Diary; you may read of Gods Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, that hee kept of his own works, for God hath ſet down every day what hee did; all the works of the Creation are ſet down, in their ſeveral reſpective daies, when they were created; as you may read at large, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. Now certain it is, that this is written for our inſtruction, and I queſtion not, but for our imitation; for
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170460:179"/>as Gods reviewing of his works every day, is an excellent preſident to put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diurnal examination, ſo his ſetting down every thing that hee did, upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of thoſe ſix daies, is an excellent preſident to put us upon diurnal Records of our actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5. To ſet down what time wee ſpend in holy duties, and the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of God, as to the actings of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and beſtowings of comforts, ſeems to bee an act of pride, and will bee ſubject to puffe us up.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. 1. Will not the remembrance of them have the ſame effect, though they bee not written down in a Diary? And are wee not bound to remember them, to remember our ſongs in the night, and the daies of the right hand of the moſt High? nay, are wee not bound in ſome caſes to tell others, what God hath done for our ſouls, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 66.16. In how many places of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> do wee read of <hi>Davids</hi> fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers unto the Lord, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of them? It is ſpiritual cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize to neglect a duty, for fear of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that accompany it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I ſuppoſe, that the goodneſs and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170460:179"/>mercies of God, will rather cauſe thee to fear, than to pride thy ſelf, and nothing humbles a ſoul more, than the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods mercies; therefore if thou ſhouldſt finde at any time thy heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to bee puft up, then do but look over thy diary, and remember thy ſins, and the mercies of God will make thy ſins out of meaſure ſinful, and by conſequence, make thee more humble; and lay thee lower.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Inſtead of puffing thee up, thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer duties, and Gods former mercies, will ſtir thee up to more thankfulneſſe, and more obedience; for when wee ſhall ſee in our Diary, that many years ago, Gods comforts, and the actings of his graces, were ſo and ſo, and finde them no more now, it will bee a ſhame and a grief unto us, and it will provoke us to more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ſtir up the graces of God in us; and in caſe of back-ſliding, it is of ſingular uſe, for wee ſhall ſee from whence wee are fallen, and what our firſt works were, that wee may do them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 6. I can neither write nor read.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, it is a wonderful, and a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing, and a thing that we have

I am confident it were better to have the uſe of ones eyes onely for reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and want them
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170460:180"/>in all other things, than to have the uſe of your eyes to all other things in the world, and want them to read <hi>Scriptures.</hi> It may bee ſome will ſay, it is an imprudent thing to ſet down ſuch particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and directions, for the keeping of a Diary, as I have done in this Chapter; but when ſince they may bee profitable, by helping thoſe that know not which way at all to mannage this duty, I am much of that Saints minde, <hi>Ignatius Jordan,</hi> who uſed to ſay, fie upon this diſcretion; I mean as hee did, when diſcretion hinders us at all in the duties of holineſs; and indeed, where one man makes uſe of his diſcretion for the furthering, ten do make uſe of it for the hindering the glory of God. In ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes where there is no ſin, and where there bee much profit to others, I think every Chriſtian ſhould ſay, Let them have the benefit, and me have the ſhame: I think ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally we do ſtand too much upon puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioes of honour, in ſuch caſes as theſe are. Now I muſt deſire you to remember, if you keep this Diary, to improve it to the utmoſt for your ſpiritual advantage, by obſerving what vowes you have made, and not kept, or prayers unanſwered,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170460:181"/>that you may keep the former, and bee more fervent in the latter, and often to review your ſins, that you may mourn for them, and ſo of the reſt; for you muſt know, the writing of them down, is not the onely work you are to do, but ſerves only as an help to enable you to do thoſe ſeveral particular works that are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the beginning of the Chapter.</p>

                  <p>NOw I ſhall come to the laſt of thoſe helps, wherein I ſhall ſet down ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſignal ſtories of Gods Providence, the actings of the graces of Gods people, and Gods manifeſting himſelf unto them, and ſeveral others, which I thought to have digeſted, and ſet down under ſeveral heads, but conſidering that many, if not all the ſtories, may bee made uſe of ſeverally, and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170460:181"/>ſo bee referred to ſeveral heads, I thought good rather to ſet them down as they came to my memory, little regarding cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of method in this, or any other caſe: I do acknowledge and bleſs God for it, that many of them have much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mee, the Lord make them ſo to you, and much more abundantly.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with an excellent ſtory of <hi>Origen,</hi> the fame, of whoſe excellent learning, and ſingleneſs of life, being brought to the ears of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> the Roman Emperour, hee ſent for him to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and commanded the Provoſt of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to furniſh him with all things neceſſary for his journey: When this Provoſt had provided him a Ship, and all things neceſſary, and beheld him but ſimply apparrel'd, hee prepared for him divers garments, in the moſt honeſt and comely ſort that Phyloſophers then uſed, but <hi>Origen</hi> would receive no part thereof, not ſo much as hoſe or ſhooes, but like as hee uſed alwayes to go from his childe-hood, (that was, in a ſingle gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cloth, and bare-foot) ſo went hee to <hi>Rome;</hi> and when at his arrival, there were brought to him a Mule, and a
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170460:182"/>Chariot to uſe, which hee liked beſt, hee anſwered, that hee was much leſs than his Maſter Chriſt, who rode but one day in all his life, and that was on a ſilly Shee-Aſſe; and therefore hee would not ride, except hee were ſick, or decrepid, ſo as his legs might not ſerve him to go; and when hee was brought into the preſence of the Emperour, and his Mother, the Emperour with moſt gentle countenance, imbraced him as hee kneeled, and enforced him to ſtand upon his feet; his Mother alſo ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with the like courteſie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced much to ſee him. The Emperour beholding his native gravity, and ſterne countenance, judged him in his heart to bee a reverend perſonage; then demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hee of him, what hee profeſſed; and when hee anſwered, <hi>Verity;</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour asked him, what hee meant thereby? It is the Word (quoth hee) of the living God, which is infallible: The Emperour asked, which is the living God, and why hee ſo called him? <hi>Origen</hi> anſwered, that hee did put that diſtinction for a difference from them, whom men (being long drowned in errour) did call their Gods, whom they confeſs to have been mortal
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170460:182"/>ones, and to have died; but the God whom he preached, was ever living &amp; never died, and is the life of all things that bee, like as hee was the <hi>Creator</hi> of them. And when the Emperour had required him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the unity of God the <hi>Creator,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly lifting up his eyes, after a ſhort me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, with an incomparable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious eloquence, forthwith opened that myſtery, and in ſuch wiſe, that as well to the Emperour, and his Mother, as to all the ſtanders by, it ſeemed they were brought out of a long ſleep, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſee things as they were indeed, and that which before they honoured and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, were but vain dreams and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: The Emperour after a little pauſe, ſaid to <hi>Origen,</hi> that hee much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, why men of ſuch great &amp; wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful knowledge, ſhould honour for God, a man that was crucified, being but of a poor eſtate and condition: O noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour (ſaid <hi>Origen</hi>) conſider what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the wiſe <hi>Athenians</hi> at this preſent do to the name and image of <hi>Codrus,</hi> their laſt King, for that when they had wars with their enemies, who had anſwer made by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that if they ſlew
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170460:183"/>not the King of <hi>Athens,</hi> they ſhould have the victory; <hi>Codrus</hi> hearing thereof, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the ſafeguard of his people before his own life, took to him the garments of a ſlave, and bearing upon his ſhoulder a burthen of ſticks, hee went to his enemies Camp, and there quarrelling of purpoſe with ſome of them, and in the preſs, hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with his knife, hee was by him that was hurt, ſtricken through the body, and ſlain, which being known to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they being confuſed, raiſed their Camp, and departed; and for this cauſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> have ever ſince had the name of <hi>Codrus</hi> in reverence, worthily, and not without cauſe. Now then conſider, moſt excellent Prince, how much more worthily, with what greater reaſon and bounden duty, ought wee, and all men, to honour Chriſt, being the Son of God, and God, who not only to preſerve mankinde from danger of the Devil, his ancient ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but alſo to deliver man out of his dark and ſtinking dungeon of errour, being ſent by God the Father, from the higheſt heavens, willingly took on him the ſervile garment of a mortal body, and hiding his Majeſty, lived under the viſage of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170460:183"/>and finally, not of his enemies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, but much more againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of his own choſen people the <hi>Jewes,</hi> unto whom hee had extended benefits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, and after his temporal Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, were his natural people and ſubjects, hee quarrelling with them, by declaring to them their abuſes, and pricking them with condigne rebukes, at the laſt, hee was not ſlain with ſo eaſie a death as <hi>Codrus</hi> was, but in moſt cruel faſhion was ſcourged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til no place in his body was without wounds, and then had long and ſharp thorns ſet and preſſed upon his head, and after long torments and deſpights, hee was conſtrained to bear a heavy Croſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on afterwards, both his hands and feet were nailed, with long and great nails of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and the Croſs, with his naked and bloody body, being lift up on high, was let fall with violence into a Mortais, that his joynts were looſened, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this torment and ingratitude, hee never grudged, but lifting up his eyes to heaven, hee prayed with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> This was the charity moſt incomparable of the Son of God,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170460:184"/>imployed for the Redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, who by the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt man that ever was created, was taken priſoner by the devil, that is to ſay, kept in the bondage of errour and ſin, from actual viſage of Gods Majeſty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til hee were on this wiſe redeemed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it was ordained at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words of <hi>Origen,</hi> they that were preſent, were wonderfully aſtonied; and therewith the Emperour with a ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy countenance ſaid to <hi>Origen,</hi> You have wonderfully ſet forth a lamentable hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but yet notwithſtanding therein bee things dark and ambiguous, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a more plain declaration; for what maketh you bold to affirm, that Jeſus, which in this wife was crucified, was the Son of God, and God, as you have called him? Sir (ſaid <hi>Origen</hi>) ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which of all creatures reaſonable ought to bee believed, and for moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proof, to bee allowed: What teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is that, ſaid the Emperour: Truly, ſaid <hi>Origen,</hi> it is in divers things. Firſt, the promiſe of God, by whom this world was made; alſo by his holy Scripture, ſpeaking by the mouths of his Prophets,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170460:184"/>as well <hi>Hebrewes</hi> as <hi>Greeks,</hi> and other, whom yee call, <hi>Vates</hi> and <hi>Sybillas:</hi> Alſo by the Nativity of Jeſus of a pure Virgin, without carnal company of a man, the moſt pure and clean form of his living. without ſin: his Doctrine divine and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial: his miracles moſt wonderful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, all grounded on charity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without oſtentation; his undoubtful and perfect Reſurrection, the third day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee was put to death; his glorious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention up into heaven, in the preſence and ſight of five hundred perſons, which were vertuous, and of credence; alſo the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, in ſpeaking all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of languages, and interpreting the <hi>Scripture,</hi> not only by himſelf, but alſo afterwards by his Apoſtles and Diſciples, and given to other, by impoſition of their hands; and all theſe ordinarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the ſaid promiſes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</p>
                  <p>I omit to ſpeak of the confeſſion of Devils, which by Jeſus, and his Apoſtles, in his Name, were caſt out of people which were poſſeſſed; the Oracles, and anſwers of them, whom yee untruly call gods, do remain in confirming this teſtimony.</p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:170460:185"/>
                  <p>And when <hi>Origen</hi> had ſaid all this, hee forthwith began there, and diſcloſed the anſwers of <hi>Apollo,</hi> made at <hi>Delphos,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Jeſus to bee God; and afterward hee recited and declared the Prophecies, as well of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> as of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> and other. Laſt, the promiſe of God to the Patriarks, by the which it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that Jeſus was Chriſt, and God; and that by his temporal nativity, he was King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that the <hi>Jewes</hi> were his natural Subjects; which declaration of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigon</hi> was ſo evident and plain, and ſet forth with ſuch wonderful eloquence, devotion, and learning, that it perſwaded the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and divers others that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to imbrace the profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, and Doctrine; and for that time, the Emperour licenſed <hi>Origen</hi> to return to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And when this Emperour on a time, perceived ſome to wonder at the learning of <hi>Origen,</hi> whereby they were induced to imbrace the Chriſtian Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Truly, (quoth hee) the humility and charity of the Chriſtian people, which I have heard of, and do daily behold, doth much more ſtir mee to believe that Chriſt is God, than his arguments. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170460:185"/>time, when two Chriſtians contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proudly together; and accuſed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſpeaking reproachful words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour, hee called them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and prohibited them to name themſelves Chriſtians, ſaying, <hi>Your pride and malice do declare, that you bee not the followers of him whom yee profeſs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though yee finde lack in mee, which I will gladly amend, yet will I not let you, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Juſtice, reprove him by your acts, whoſe life and doctrine you all do affirm to be uncorrupted and without lack.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was this Noble Emperour, and his Mother, with divers others, by the learned ſpeech of this man (agreeing with the ſimplicity and ſingleneſs of his life, void of all pride and pomp, and the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and charity uſed in thoſe daies among Chriſtians) induced to imbrace Chriſtian profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtoried of a certain Doctor, who ſeeing a poor beggar, that had his feet fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, fowl, and naked, whoſe cloaths were not worth a half penny, and hee ſaluted him on his ſort, <hi>God give you good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, my friend:</hi> The poor man anſwered him; Sir, I do not remember that ever I
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170460:186"/>had an evil morrow: The Doctor ſaid unto him, God give you a good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py life, wherefore ſay you that, quoth the beggar to him, for I was never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy? which the Doctor not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſaid unto him again, God bleſs you my friend, I pray you ſpeak what you mean: Then the poor beggar an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, Good Mr. Doctor, I ſhall do it willingly; You know you bad mee good morrow, whereunto I replied, that I had never any ill morrow; for when I have hunger, I praiſe God, if it freeze, hail, ſnow rain, bee it fair or fowl, I give praiſe to God; though I bee poor, miſerable and deſpiſed on earth, I give thanks unto God, and therefore I never had any evil mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: You did wiſh unto mee alſo a good and happy life, whereunto I made you anſwer, that I was never unhappy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have learned alwayes to reſign my ſelf to the will of God, being certain, that all his works cannot bee but very good, by reaſon whereof, all that happeneth unto mee by his permiſſion, bee it proſperity, adverſity, ſweet or ſower, I receive it, as from his own hand, with great joy and comfort, and therefore I was never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170460:186"/>for I never deſired any thing but the good pleaſure of God; which the poor man having ſaid, the Doctor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, but what would you ſay, if God damn you: If God would damn mee, ſaid the poor man, verily I have two arms to imbrace him, <hi>viz.</hi> of faith and love, by which I would imbrace him in ſuch ſort, that hee ſhould bee conſtrained to deſcend with mee to hell, and I had rather, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon, bee in hell with God, than without him in Paradiſe. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor learned in this communication, that a true reſignation, accompanied with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humility of heart, is the ſhorteſt way to attain unto the love of God. After that, hee asked of him from whence he came, unto whom hee made anſwer, that God had ſent him: The Doctor enquired yet of him, where hee had found God? I found him (quoth hee) ſo ſoon as I had renounced all creatures, and my ſelf: And where didſt thou leave him, replied the Doctor: I left him, anſwered the poor man, with the pure and clean of heart, and amongſt men of good will: But who art thou, my friend, quoth the Doctor unto him? The poor man made him anlwer,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170460:187"/>that hee was a King: and hee asking him, where his Kingdome was: It is (quoth hee) in my ſoul, for I can ſo well rule and govern my ſenſes, as well outward as inward, that all my affections and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do obey grace, which Kingdome is without doubt more excellent than all the Kingdomes of this world. Moreover, the foreſaid Doctor demanded of him, who it was that had brought him into ſo great perfection? It was ſilence, anſwered the poor man, and my high and lofty medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the union which I had with God; I could take no repoſe nor comfort in any creature of the world, by meanes whereof I found out my God, who will comfort mee world without end.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes conſidered the great prudence of <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> and the great ſucceſs that God gave to it; for hee having formerly delivered a Petition to <hi>Theodotius,</hi> for the calling in of his Edicts, whereby hee gave leave to the <hi>arrians</hi> publickly to preach, hee took this way to accompliſh that deſign; <hi>Theodoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> having made <hi>Arcadius</hi> his Son <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and co-Emperour with him; as divers of the Roman Emperours did, eſtabliſh
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170460:187"/>their Succeſſors with equal honour and power with themſelves, during their lives; divers Biſhops, and other Miniſters, came to ſhew their reſpects, and to ſalute <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius,</hi> the new Emperour, with whom <hi>Amphilochius</hi> came alſo, a man of great piety; but for gifts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellencies of ſmall account, all the reſt of the Biſhops having ſhown their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſpects to <hi>Theodotius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius, Amphilochius</hi> only ſaluted <hi>Theodotius,</hi> but took no notice of his Son <hi>Arcadius,</hi> who ſat there in all his Robes of Majeſty, and received equal honour of all others. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odotius</hi> ſuppoſing that hee had forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, told him, that his Son was made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with him, and ſo imminded him of his duty. <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> upon <hi>Theodotius</hi> his ſpeech, went to <hi>Arcadius,</hi> and ſtroak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him upon the head, ſaid, it is a very pretty hopeful boy: <hi>Theodotius</hi> being wonderfully incenſed with this contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble carriage, in a great deal of rage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to bee carried away to priſon, when hee was gone a little way, he turned back, and ſpake thus to <hi>Theodotius:</hi> Are you thus incenſed, becauſe I do not give the ſame honour to your Son, whom you
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170460:188"/>have made equal to your ſelf, by your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts? And do you think that God will bee will pleaſed with you, that ſuffer the <hi>Arrians</hi> ſo to diſhonour Chriſt, whom God hath exalted far above all heavens, and given him a name above all names, that at the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> every knee ſhall bow, and hath ſet him on his right hand, and will, that all men ſhall honour the Sonne, as they honor the Father: Upon this <hi>Theodotius</hi> calls back <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philochius,</hi> and receiveth him into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, calls in his Edicts, that gave li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the <hi>Arrians.</hi> Thus God honours them that honour Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>A Chriſtian Matron, of excellent parts and piety, languiſhing long under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of hideous temptations, wofully at length yeelded to diſpair, and oft times attempted the deſtruction of her ſelf, and after often and curious ſeeking occaſion for that bloody fact, at laſt getting upon a rock that hung over into the Sea, putting off her apparrel, ſhee threw her ſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the ſame, but receiving no hurt by her fall, ſhee was there miraculouſſy preſerved, for the ſpace of two hours, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring all that while induſtriouſly to

But at length, by Gods Providence, liſtening on a time, (though very unwillingly at firſt) to her Husband, reading that Text, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth Eternity, whoſe name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones;</hi> by little and little, abundance of ſpiritual comfort flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into her heart, in which condition ſhee continued many years after, even until her death, which fell out, <hi>Anno Chriſti,</hi> 1595 <hi>Bolton.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Katherine Brettergh,</hi> upon her death-bed, was aſſaulted with moſt grievous temptations, which made her cry out, that a roaring wilderneſs of Wo was within her, that her ſins had made her a prey to Satan, and wiſhed that ſhee had never been born, or that ſhe had been made any other creature rather than a woman, crying, <hi>Wo, wo, wo, &amp;c.</hi> a weak, a woful, a wretched, a forſaken woman;
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170460:189"/>but at length, by Gods wonderful mercy, ſhee recovered ſuch comfort, that in the raviſhments of ſpirit; ſhee cryed out, <hi>O Lord Jeſus, doeſt thou pray for mee? O bleſſed and ſweet Saviour, how wonderful! how wonderful: how wonderful are thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? O! thy love is unſpeakable, that haſt dealt ſo graciouſly with mee. O Lord my God, bleſſed bee thy name for evermore, which haſt ſhewed mee the path of life: Thou didſt, O Lord, hide thy face from mee for a little ſeaſon, but with everlaſting mercy thou haſt compaſſion on mee; and now bleſſed Lord, thy comfortable preſence is come, yea, thou art come to thy hand-maid, with fulneſs of joyes, and abundance of conſolations: O the joyes, the joys, the joys, that I feel in my ſoul: Oh they be wonderful! they bee wonderful! they bee wonderful! O Lord, I feel thy mercy, and I am aſſured of thy love, and ſo certain am I of thy love, as thou art the God of truth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo ſure do I know my ſelf to bee thine, and this my ſoul knoweth right well; O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bee the Lord!

                  <p>There is a famous ſtory of providence in <hi>Bradwardine</hi> to this purpoſe; A certain Hermit, that was much tempted, and was utterly unſatisfied, concerning the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and reſolved to journey from place to place, till hee met with ſome that could ſatisfie him; an Angel, in the ſhape of a man, joyned-himſelf with him, as hee was journeying, telling him, that hee was ſent from God to ſatisfie him in his doubts of providence: The firſt night they lodged at the houſe of a very holy
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:170460:192"/>man, and they ſpent their time in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of heaven, and praiſes of God, and were entertained with a great deal of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and joy: In the morning, when they departed, the Angel took with him a great cup of gold: The next night, they came to the houſe of another holy man, who made them very welcome, and exceedingly rejoyced in their ſociety and diſcourſe, the Angel notwithſtanding, at his departure, kill'd an Infant in the Cradle, which was his only ſon, being many years before childleſs, and therefore was a very fond father of this childe: The third night they came to another houſe, where they had like free entertainment, as before; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Family had a Steward, whom hee highly prized, and told them how happy he accounted himſelf in having ſuch a faithful ſervant; next morning, he ſent this his Steward with them part of their way, to direct them therein; as they were going over the Bridge, the Angel flung the Steward into the River, and drowned him: The laſt night they came to a very wicked mans houſe, where they had very untoward entertainment, yet the Angel, next morning, gave him the cup of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170460:193"/>gold. All this being done, the Angel ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Hermit, whether he underſtood thoſe things? he anſwered, his doubts of providence were encreaſed, not reſolved, for he could not underſtand why he ſhould deal ſo hardly with thoſe holy men, who received them with ſo much love and joy, and yet give ſuch a gift to that wicked man, who uſed them ſo unworthily; the Angel ſaid, I will now expound theſe things unto you: The firſt houſe where we came, the Maſter of it was a holy man, yet drinking in that cup every morning, it being too large, it did ſomewhat unfit him for holy duties, though not ſo much, that others, or himſelf, did perceive it, ſo I took it away, ſince it is better for him to looſe the cup of gold, than his temperance. The Maſter of the Family, where we lay the ſecond night, was a man given much to prayer and meditation, and ſpent much time in holy duties, and very liberal to the poor, all the while he was childleſs, but as ſoon as hee had a Son, he grew ſo fond of it, ſpent ſo much time in playing with it, that he exceedingly neglected his former holy exerciſe, and gave but little to the poor, thinking he could never lay
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:170460:193"/>up enough for his childe, therefore I have taken the infant to heaven, and left him to ſerve God better upon earth: the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, whom I did drown, had plotted to kill his Maſter the night following; and as for that wicked man, to whom I gave the cup of gold, he was to have nothing in the other world, I gave him ſomething in this, which notwithſtanding will prove a ſnare to him, for he will be more intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and let him that is filthy, be more filthy. The truth of this ſtory I affirm not, but the moral is very good; for it ſhewes, that God is an indulgent Father to the Saints, when he moſt afflicts them; and that when he ſets the wicked on high, hee ſets them alſo in ſlippery places, and their proſperity is their ruine, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.32.</p>
                  <p>Acertain godly woman, riding behinde her Husband, who was a perſecutor of Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> one need not add, that he was a wicked man, as they were riding, it thundered and lightened extraordinarily, which was ſo terrible, that he trembled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; his Wife, with a cheerful voice, ſaid, Husband, what ail you? why do you tremble thus? Hee anſwered, Do you ask mee why I tremble? Do you not
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:170460:194"/>hear how horribly it thunders? Shee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, yes, I hear it: And do not you tremble alſo? ſaith hee: Shee anſwered, no: Not tremble, ſaid hee: Shee again anſwered, no, and ſaid, ſhee was not at all afraid: Not afraid! ſaid hee, Why how comes that to paſs, that ſuch dreadful claps of thunder make you not afraid? I will tell you why, ſaid ſhee, with a very cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful voice, becauſe it is the voice of my Father: Hee was amazed at her cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and anſwer, and began to think with himſelf, ſurely theſe Puritanes have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within them, that they are able to bear up in ſuch ſtorms, and that they have peace, and are cheerful, while I tremble; and being not far off, immediately he did ride to Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> beſeeching pardon, that he had perſecuted him, and deſired that he would tell him, what he ſhould do to be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>A Doctor of Divinity, of ſingular learning and piety, (I forbear names, ſince the Parties, whom this ſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes, are, as I ſuppoſe, all yet living) his maid being to go to Market, came to him for money, but all the money he and his Wife could make, was but five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:170460:194"/>to get proviſion for the following week, though hee had many hundreds a year for merly; his Wife being much troubled that they were brought to ſuch ſtraits, and that they were like to bee greater, fell a weeping, and told her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that there was little likelihood they could live together, and that therefore ſhe would take one or two of her children with her, and live amongſt her own friends, if hee could provide for himſelf, and the reſt of his children: Nay, dear Wife, ſaid hee, wee have lived thus long together, let not us now part, let us relye on Gods providence; She in her grief and haſte, anſwered, Well, ſend Providence to Market, and ſee what it will bring home: It was ſo that day, a Noble man, who knew this Doctor very well, dining with divers Gentlemen at an Inne, who were to go a Hawking that afternoon, looking out of the Window, ſaw his Maid, who being an ancient ſervant, he knew, and ſent for her up, asking her, how her Maſter did: She anſwered, very well, and fell a weeping: He enquiring the cauſe, ſhe told him what ſtraits they were brought to, hee wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being troubled at it, called the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:170460:195"/>Inne-keeper, and wiſhed him to give that Maid ten pound, and every one of the Gentlemen gave twenty ſhillings a piece; ſo the Doctor ſending Providence to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, it brought him home fifteen pound; doubtleſs it is, becauſe we do not truſt, not becauſe God either cannot, or will not give, that makes us ſo often want mercies, and ſuch providences would be uſual, if our confidence in God were ſo.</p>
                  <p>A Widdow Gentlewoman that I knew, being unable to follow Suits of Law, loſt a conſiderable Eſtate, and was fain to work for her living, ſhe married a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Miniſter that had a great living, but he that was ſequeſtred dying, another was preſented, and this Miniſter was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and for a pretended debt caſt into priſon, his Wife being great with-childe, and ready to lye down: Hereupon the Mother went to the houſe, to fetch away her Son-in-laws goods, where ſhe found another of her Daughters neer death, ſhe not knowing before of her ſickneſs: The workmen that were mending the houſe for him that was to come to it, would needs uncover the Chamber where this ſick Maid lay; the Mother deſired them,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:170460:195"/>but to forbear till her Daughter died, or recovered, but they would not; and when ſhe went to carry away the goods, there ſtood two ready to ſeize upon them, one for Taxes, and the other for debt.

At the fortnights end, when God was pleaſed to abate her meaſure of joy, ſhe came to a ſetled peace of conſcience, and aſſurance of the love of God, ſo that for twenty years after, ſhe had not ſo much as a Cloud upon her ſpirit, or the leaſt queſtioning of her intereſt in Chriſt, but hath lived cheerfully and contentedly, without the leaſt murmuring againſt any of Gods diſpenſations, though ſhe hath had many and great afflictions, but her carriage hath been eminently Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, full of patience, yea, rejoycing in the Lord, in the midſt of all her ſufferings.</p>

                  <p>This wonderful, and almoſt miraculous deliverance that God beſtowed, becauſe it ſeems almoſt incredible, I have annexed the names of thoſe that teſtifie it, with one of whom I am very well acquainted, and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:170460:200"/>know him to be one of ſo much veracity, that I durſt believe it upon his ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, though I ſhould not be willing to propoſe it to others, without more witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                     <hi>Jaddus,</hi> the High Prieſt, underſtanding that <hi>Alexander</hi> was highly incenſed againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and intended ſpeedily to come againſt it, he deſired the <hi>Jewes</hi> to keep a Faſt, as alſo he himſelf did, and offered Sacrifice, begging of God to direct him what ſhould be done in this matter; and the next night, in his ſleep, God appeared unto him, and wiſhed him to open the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in all his Prieſtly Robes to meet <hi>Alexander,</hi> the reſt of the Prieſts being cloathed all in white, which he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Alexander,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw him, fell proſtrate before him, his Army won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at his carriage: <hi>Parmenio</hi> asked him what he meant to worſhip the High-Prieſt, when all others worſhipped him: He anſwered, he did not worſhip the High-Prieſt, but that God, whom the High-Prieſt ſerved: For, ſaith <hi>Alexander,</hi> when I was in <hi>Dio,</hi> conſidering what to do in my wats, God appeared unto me in this very artire, and wiſhed me to go on, and hee
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:170460:200"/>would proſper me, and I never ſince ſaw any in that attire before now; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that I do ſhew that reſpect to the High Prieſt, and then giving the High-Prieſt his hand, was conducted by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, and offered Sacrifice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his directions, who alſo did ſhew him the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he told him it was propheſied, that one of the <hi>Grecians</hi> ſhould deſtroy the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and hee ſuppoſed that hee was the perſon meant by the Prophecy, of which <hi>Alexander</hi> was very joyful, and beſtowed great favours, both on the High-Prieſts, and the reſt of the <hi>Jewes.</hi>

                  <p>Now becauſe of all the ſtories of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> either in the time of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, or ſince, by the far greater cruelty of the Popiſh perſecution: I do not know that ever I read any ſtory equal to this, which is recorded by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> of the Martyrdome of the ſeven ſons of one Mother; I thought good to inſert this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which, though as for the ſubſtance of it, it is in the book of <hi>Macchabees,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceeding more large in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> I have tranſcribed it out of him; and the rather do I ſet down this ſtory, becauſe
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:170460:201"/>generally Expoſitors do think, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (in <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 11.35.) hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſufferings of theſe worthy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and it was thus: <hi>Antiochus,</hi> whom the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> calls a vile perſon, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.21. after he had Martyr'd <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> a man of great age, reverence, piety, and conſtancy, cauſed ſeven brethren, who were brought up, and inſtructed by that bleſſed fore-named <hi>Martyr, Eleazer,</hi> to be brought forth to <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant beholding them, and their Mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, with merry and gladſome countenance, hee thus ſpake unto the children, I wiſh your good, O admirable young men, for ſo both your beauty of body, and Noble parentage, perſwade mee, do not therefore like mad men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt my command, avoid not only tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but death alſo; for I deſire not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exalt you unto honour, but alſo to encreaſe your riches and poſſeſſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the ſuperſtitious and ſuperfluous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of your Countrymen, and imbrace our Religion, which if you refuſe to do, (as I hope you will not) I will deviſe all torments, whereby I may by a lingring and painful death, conſume you; and to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:170460:201"/>the end hee might terrifie them the more, hee commanded all inſtruments of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bee preſented to their view; ſo wheels, rods, hooks, rakes, racks, caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, cages, gridirons, were brought forth, and engines to torment the fingers and hands, gauntlets, bellowes, brazen pots, and frying pans. Then <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſaid, Conſent unto mee, O prudent young men, for if that I command you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſin, yet do not you offend in doing it, ſeeing you commit it only upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion: But the young youths, guided by a Divine Spirit, contemned ſo many kindes of torments, and deſpiſed the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants threats and flatteries, and with one conſent, denied to eat of the Sacrificed Swines fleſh, as they were commanded; wherefore, ſaid they, doeſt thou perſecute us that are innocent, wee both deſire, and wiſh to die, and will, until ſuch time as death expelleth life, firmly keep that which God commanded, and <hi>Moſes</hi> taught us; and do not thou ſeek to ſeduce us, by proteſting feigned love towards us, the pardon which thou doſt offer, is to us more dangerous than puniſhment, we are arm'd with contempt of death, and eſteem
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:170460:202"/>not thy words, as being by our late Maſter <hi>Eleazer,</hi> taught to deſpiſe them: Why then doſt thou think ſuch puſillanimity to bee in us young men, ſeeing of late thou foundeſt ſuch courage in an old man; we follow him, thou canſt not try and know our mindes, except by tearing our bodies, thou ſearch them out; Wee will ſafely and ſecurely ſuffer for our God any thing, and leaving this earth, we ſhall bee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained into heaven, and thou for ſo tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing moſt cruelly upon innocent ſouls, ſhalt bee reſerved unto hell fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antiochus</hi> being greatly moved, to ſee, that hee could neither prevail by fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, nor threatnings, hee cauſed them to bee beaten with Bulls Piſles; and firſt, hee commanded the eldeſt of the ſeven brethren to be ſtript, and ſtretched out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rack, and his hands to bee bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, and then to bee moſt cruelly beaten, who wearied his tormentors by his ſufferings, ſo that they more deſired to leave beating him, than hee deſired they ſhould leave: This done, hee was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wheel, and a weight hang'd upon his feet, and ſo ſtretched round about it, that his ſinews and intrals brake, and ſo his
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:170460:202"/>pains encreaſed; yet for all the pain, his mouth was not hindred from calling upon God, who beheld all; and reproving the Tyrant that deviſed thoſe torments for the innocent, hee cryed out after this manner, O thou that perſecuteſt the Majeſty of God, I whom thou thus tormenteſt, am no <hi>Conjurer,</hi> nor <hi>Murderer,</hi> but one that dies for the truth, and obſerving of the Lawes of God: Then the Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors wiſhing him to yeeld, Your wheels, ſaid hee, are not ſo ſharp and cruel, that I thereby will bee forced to forſake heaven, whereon my minde is fixed; tear my fleſh, yea, if it ſo pleaſe you, roaſt it at the fire, torture each part of my body with ſeveral cruelties, you ſhall for all this finde your ſelves unable to force us young men to ſin. As hee thus ſpake, a fire was kindled, and hee, as hee was upon the wheel racked, was ſo thrown into the fire. And thus hee was ſo burned, that his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els appeared, he (being nothing moved, though his fleſh was) out of the midſt of the fire, cryed thus to his brethren; O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved brethren, learn by mee an example of conſtancy, contemn and deſpiſe the alluring baits of this world, and rather
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:170460:203"/>obey God than <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who can, if hee pleaſe, humble the proud and mighty, and exalt the lowly and dejected. As thus he ſpake, hee was taken out of the flame, and flean alive, his tongue was pull'd out of his mouth, and hee put into a Frying-pan, and ſo hee ended his dayes. After him, the ſecond Brother being haled by the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Antiochus,</hi> before hee asked him whether hee would relent, cauſed all thoſe inſtruments of torments to bee ſhown him alſo, thereby to terrifie him; but hee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereat moved, and denying to eat of their foreſaid Sacrifice, his hands were bound with iron chains, and hee being hang'd up by them, the Skin of his body was flean from the Crown of his head un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his knees, ſo that the intrals in his breſt appeared naked, yet in ſuch manner, as he might abide great torments, for hee was caſt before a cruel Libbard, thirſting moſt extremely after blood, to the intent that he might devoure with his teeth the reſt of his body, but the beaſt ſmelling of him, forgat his cruelty, and turning away his face, hee did no hurt to the <hi>Martyr;</hi> but hereat the Tyrantsrage encreaſed, and the <hi>Martyr</hi> by ſuffering ſuch torments, was
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:170460:203"/>made more conſtant, crying aloud, O how pleaſant is that death unto me, which is cauſed by all ſorts of torments for Gods ſake; yea, ſo much the more pleaſant, for that I aſſuredly hope to finde reward for it in heaven; Let theſe torments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon mee (O Tyrant) ſatisfie thy cruelty, for my pain is not by thy tortures encreaſed, but rather my pleaſure, as thou ſhalt finde by my patience in this agony; more willing am I to ſuffer, than thou to puniſh, yea my pain in ſuffering, is leſs than thine by inflicting the ſame upon me; I am tormented for the truth and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Law, and the Juſtice of God ſhall baniſh thee from thy Regal Seat, thou by tormenting art tormented, and almoſt conſumed, thy wrath and fury being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpent upon mee in vain, thou ſhalt not eſcape the Day of Judgement, eternal pains are there prepared for thee, which neither thy profane minde is able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, nor thy cruelty of power to decline, thy ſinful ſoul being condemned to eternal puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>Thus hee remaining conſtantly in his Faith, and animated by his Brothers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, departed unto heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:170460:204"/>
                  <p>Then the third Son was brought, whom all pittied for the death of his two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and many exhorted him, by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers examples, to deſiſt from his opinion, and ſo avoid puniſhment, but hee being hereat angry, thus replyed: One Father begot us, one Mother did bear us, one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter inſtructed us, wee are all of one mind, and all alike affected, do therefore no longer prolong the time in vain; I came hither for to ſuffer, and not to ſpeak, uſe all your tyranny poſſible againſt this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for you have no power at all over my ſoul. The Tyrant hereat moved to ſee this third nothing relent by his brothers deaths; he deviſed more cruelty, than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wit alone could invent; wherefore hee commanded a Globe to bee brought, and tied the holy Martyr about it in ſuch ſort, that all his bones were ſet out of joynt, and diſplaced, whereat the holy Martyr was nothing diſmaide; the skin alſo of his head and face was pulled off, and then hee was put upon the wheel, but hee could not bee racked any worſe, for that all his bones were diſplaced, and did hang one ſeparated from another in moſt pitiful manner, And when blood iſſued
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:170460:204"/>from him abundantly, hee was deprived of the uſe of his hands and feet, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his life to bee ſpent, hee ſpake thus, and died: Wee (O Tyrant) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this torment for the love of God, and thou the Author of ſuch unjuſt cruelty ſhalt ſuffer everlaſting pain; then his tongue being cut out of his mouth, hee was put into a Frying-pan, and ſo amidſt thoſe torments yeelded up the Ghoſt: Next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter followed the fourth Brother, whom all the people perſwaded and entreated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the King, but hee contemning their exhortations, ſaid thus with all conſtancy, Your fire ſhall not ſeparate mee from the Law of God, nor from my Brethren, who inſtead of this mortal life, enjoy life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: I denounce unto thee, O Tyrant, deſtruction and overthrow, but to ſuch as believe, ſalvation. Make tryal of mee therefore, and ſee if God will forſake me, who hath with open and ſtretched out armes, received my three brethren that are gone before mee, and whom the Womb of ſo holy a Mother at ſeveral times brought forth unto glory. The cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hearing this, was much moved, and leapt down from his Chair to torment this
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:170460:205"/>
                     <hi>Martyr</hi> himſelf, that ſo hee might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him, and in his fury commanded his tongue to bee cut out, but hee hereat not terrified, ſaid unto <hi>Antiochus,</hi> This cruelty will nothing avail thee, neither ſhalt thou hereby, as thou ſuppoſeſt, conquer mee; our God needs not by voice to bee awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, but rather by ſecret cogitation to bee prayed unto, to help his ſervants; and our God knoweth all things before wee ask; and before wee our ſelves enter into cogitation thereof, hee underſtandeth our neceſſity; cut out my tongue, thou canſt not cut out my minde, while my life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth: Thoſe prayers which by it I have uttered to Almighty God, have taught it to ſuffer: Would God thou wouldſt ſo ſanctifie all parts of my body by puniſhing them, for thou therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteſt puniſhment upon thy ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon mee, and think not that thou ſhalt thus eſcape long unpuniſhed: When hee had thus ſpoken, his tongue was cut out of his mouth, and hee bound to a ſtake, and there hee was beaten with ropes ends, and hee did patiently endure this, notwithſtanding the colour of his face became dead and wan, being looſed from
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:170460:205"/>thence, hee was put upon the wheel, and then praying for the Church of God, hee by death went unto the reſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Then the fifth Brother, before hee was haled to torments, ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; Behold I come to bee puniſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou command mee, hope not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any jot to alter his minde, who, as thou ſeeſt, deſireth to bee tormented; the blood of my four innocent brethren, which thou haſt ſhed, hath condemned thee to hell fire. I am to make them up the number of five, that by it thy pains may bee encreaſed: Tell mee for what offence by us committed, doſt thou thus puniſh us? For what impiety doſt thou ſo perſecute us? What villainy have wee committed? What wickedneſs, what naughtineſs have wee attempted? This is all thou canſt alledge againſt us, that wee honour God our <hi>Creatour,</hi> and live juſtly, in obedience of his Lawes, and therefore do not eſteem thy puniſhments, but they are to us honour and ſalvation, and not puniſhment, we ſhall bee greatly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, if no part of us bee left free from torment.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt thus hee ſpake, his Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:170460:206"/>by the Kings command, took him, and caſt him into a brazen pot, and was preſt down in it, his head to his feet, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hee ſuffered all other torments, which his Brethren had endured, yet not amazed hereat, hee ſuddenly ſtarted up, and thus hee ſaid, Cruel Tyrant, how great benefits doeſt thou againſt thy will beſtow upon us; yea, the more thou art incenſed againſt us, the more acceptable to God ſhalt thou make us; yea, I ſhould bee ſorry, if thou ſhouldſt ſhew mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee, this ſhort affliction gaineth us life everlaſting; if this temporal death ſhould not betide mee, everlaſting life could not befal mee: and thus hee finiſhed his agony, and died. Then the Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors laid hands upon the ſixth Brother, who was permitted, either to chuſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or elſe puniſhment, but hee aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at his offer, ſaid, although I be youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in my years than my <hi>Martyr'd</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yet my conſtancy of minde to theirs is not inferiour, for wee were all nouriſh'd up together, all together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and wee will all die together in the fear of God; haſten therefore to thy deviſed torments, and that time which
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:170460:206"/>thou wouldſt ſpend in exhorting mee, ſpend it in deviſing tortures for mee. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> hereat confounded, commanded him to bee bound to a Pillar, with his head hanging down, and this done, hee cauſed a fire to bee made ſo far off him, that it could not burn him, but roſt him: Hee alſo commanded, as hee hung, to bee prickt with Awles, that ſo the heat might pierce into the holes that they made in his fleſh. Whilſt thus hee was tormented, much blood like froth gathered about his head, and face, and hee then ſpake in this manner, O noble fight! O valiant war! O ſtrife beyond piety and impiety! theſe men have paſt their agonies, whoſe Crown of Martyrdome is the puniſhment of their perſecutors: I do moſt willingly follow my Brethren, that as by blood I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd unto them, ſo by death I may not bee ſeparated from them; deviſe ſome new torment, for thoſe which thou haſt already deviſed, are already overcome; our God giveth us more courage to ſuffer, than thou haſt to puniſh, and ſo the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of God remaineth firm in us: And as hee thus ſpake, one took hold of his tongue with a hot pair of Tongs, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:170460:207"/>ſuffering the ſame torments that his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren had done, and fryed in a Frying-Pan, hee gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Six of the Brethren being now dead, by diverſity of torments, onely one of the ſeven remained alive with his Mother, younger in years (but not in conſtancy of minde) than the reſt of his Brethren; hee preſenting himſelf before the Tyrant, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to compaſſion, both for that he was left alone, and the laſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and alſo that hee was to periſh, wherefore hee called the childe unto him, and into a place where no inſtruments of torments were, and taking him by the hand, hee ſaid thus unto him, hoping to win him by fair ſpeeches; By thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns calamity, thou now well haſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what is prepared for thee, if thou diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey mee, deliver thy ſelf therefore from theſe torments, and I will give thee what honour my Kingdome can afford, thou ſhalt bee a Magiſtrate, and General of my Army, and one of my Counſellors; but perceiving himſelf not to prevail, hee cauſed the young mans Mother to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, who coming, and ſtanding neer her Son, the Tyrant ſaid thus unto
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:170460:207"/>her, Where are now, O worthy woman, all thy Children? Behold, of ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, if thou pleaſe, thou mayeſt have one left, adviſe therefore thy childe, and molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his obſtinate minde by wholeſome counſel.</p>
                  <p>The Mother having heard what the King ſaid, ſhee bowed her ſelf unto the King, which done, that the King might not underſtand her, ſhee ſpake in Hebrew to her childe, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Pitty thy Mother, O Son, and comfort thy ſorrowful Mother, who bare thee nine moneths in my womb, and gave thee ſuck three years, and with great induſtry have brought thee up to this age; I pray thee, dear Son, conſider the heaven and earth, and all that in them is, and know that God created them all of nothing, who alſo of nothing made mankinde, fear not this <hi>Ethnicks</hi> pains and torments, but i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate thy Brethren, and contemn death, that in the day of mercy I may receive thee, and thy Brethren again in heaven.</p>
                  <p>As his Mother thus admoniſhed him, hee in the Hebrew Tongue requeſted to be unbound, for that hee had a ſecret to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe unto the King, who being unfetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:170460:208"/>hee preſently ran to the torments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, for there was a Frying-pan red hot, that was prepared for ſuch as were to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, unto the which the childe coming, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering his Brethren, and beholding alſo the King, hee ſaid unto him, Who gave thee this Purple? And who exalted thee to this Kingdome and Dignity? even hee whom thou in us doſt perſecute, whoſe ſervants and worſhippers thou killeſt, and tormenteſt, for which thy wickedneſſe, thou ſhalt ſuffer eternal fire, and torments, which ſhall have no end; thou art of higher dignity and authority in this world, than other men, yet hee that made other men made thee alſo of the ſame nature, that they are of, all men are born; and muſt die alike; hee that killeth another, ſheweth that himſelf may bee killed; thou teareſt and tormenteſt thy own pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and image all in vain, thou in thy fury killedſt him, whom not long ſince God created like thy ſelf, and according to the ſame Law, thou thinkeſt all lawful which thy Kingly power can command, thou pulleſt out our tongues, and teareſt our bodies with fleſh-hooks, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt us with fire; but they who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:170460:208"/>ſuffered this, have received ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joy for their reward, and thou ſhalt anſwer for all the puniſhments infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon them; think not that I expect any favour at thy hands, I will follow my Brethren, and remain conſtant in our Law.</p>
                  <p>The Tyrant hearing this, was wroth, and cauſed him to bee tormented, but his Mother in torment comforted him, and with her kinde hands held his head, when with violence of the tortures, blood iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his mouth, noſe, and privy parts, the Tormentors not ceaſing till life in him was almoſt ſpent, but they (by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment) gave over, and ſo hee took ſtrength again, to endure more than any of his Brethren had done; at laſt, his hands and armes being cut off, hee lifted up his eyes to heaven, and cryed, O <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donas,</hi> O <hi>Sabaor,</hi> bee merciful unto mee, and receive mee into the company of my Brethren; let thy wrath now ceaſe, and ſhew mercy to thy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for thy Names ſake. Having ſaid thus, his tongue being pull'd out, hee of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord went into the fiery Frying-pan, and ſo to the great admiration of <hi>Antiochus</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:170460:209"/>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Deering,</hi> an eminent Miniſter in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, being at a great Feaſt, had a young gallant that ſate over againſt him, who amongſt other vain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, brake forth into ſwearing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> gravely and ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him; the Gallant, being impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of reproof, flung a glaſs of Beer in his face; Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> took no notice of the abuſe, but wiped his face, and fell to his meat, as before: The young Gallant fell to his old diſcourſe, and ſwore again, and Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> reproved him, as afore, upon which, with more violence and rage, hee flung another glaſs of Beer into his face, but hee again ſhewed his zeal for Gods glory to bee right, by his meek and ſilent bearing of this injury alſo, at which the young gallant being aſtoniſhed, roſe up from the Table, and fell down on his knees, and asked him forgiveneſs, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that if any one had offered him thoſe affronts, hee would have ſtab'd him to the heart.</p>
                  <p>A certain Knight, not many years ſince, was playing at Tables, his Chaplain ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, the Knight being angry, ſwore; whereupon his Chaplain reproved him,

To whom the Chaplain anſwered; nay, but who art thou, that thou dareſt thus blaſpheme thy Maker? The Knight being convinced by this juſt reproof, retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Chamber, and gave his Chaplain twenty pieces for his faithfulneſſe to him.</p>
                  <p>A Miller in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> ſitting in an Ale-houſe, on a Sabbath day, with one of his companions, ſaid to him, I hear that bawling <hi>Hooker</hi> (meaning Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> that precious ſervant of Chriſt, that died in <hi>New-England</hi>) is come to Town, let us go and hear him, we ſhall have excellent ſport, and accordingly they went on purpoſe to jeer him, but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God the Sermon ſo wrought upon him, that being pricked to the heart, hee went to Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> entreating him to tell him, what hee might do to bee ſaved? and afterwards went with him to <hi>New-England.</hi>

                     <hi>Thomas Ward</hi> of <hi>Tiſo,</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> was all his younger dayes very looſe, and diſſolute, a ſcoffer at, and enemy to all
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:170460:210"/>goodneſs, and an hater of good men; but it pleaſed God at laſt to conver thim after a ſtrange and wonderful manner, which was this: In a morning, as hee lay in his bed, plotting and contriving how to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt &amp; perſecute ſome of his godly Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and to bring them into the Biſhops Court at <hi>Worcester,</hi> there appeared a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, of a City, wherein there were many poor ragged Lambs in the ſtreets, and a man driving of them, and he heard a voice, ſaying to him, What are theſe? to which hee anſwered, ſheep: Then ſaid the voice again, theſe are my ſheep whom thou perſecuteſt: Preſently after, hee ſaw another Viſion, of a pile of Faggots, and heard the voice, ſaying, What are theſe? Hee anſwered, Faggots: Then ſaid the voice, as theſe are bound up for the fire, ſo thou deſerveſt to bee bound hand and foot, and caſt into everlaſting fire: Truth Lord, ſaid hee; yet withal hee cryed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to the Lord for mercy; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after hee ſaw in another Viſion, a Pillar of Braſs, but ſo bright and glorious, that hee was not able to look upon it: Then ſaid the voice, bee of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for thou art a Choſen Veſſel, which
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:170460:210"/>ſhall ſuffer many things for my Names ſake; to which hee ſaid, Lord, if it be thy will, let it bee now; and preſently he had a blow given him on his ſide, as with a dagger, the mark whereof hee carried with him to his grave. After this, it pleaſed God to raiſe him up with comfort, and he became an eminent Profeſſor and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous for the truth, though hee met with much perſecution by the Prelatical Party, from which hee was ſcarce ever free, till they and their Courts were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: This hee himſelf related to Maſter <hi>Benjamin Lovel,</hi> a godly Miniſter, that lived neer to him, and who was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with him, and from whoſe mouth this was wrote.</p>
                  <p>An exceeding poor woman, that was given much to ſcolding, and debauchery, uſed to ſpeak much againſt going to bee examined by the Miniſter before Admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sacrament, yet at laſt, by the importunity of her Husband, ſhee was prevailed with to go to her Miniſter, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Fairclough,</hi> who finding her groſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, diſcovered the great danger of it to her, and withal, inſtructed her with ſo much mildneſs and ſweetneſs, that ſhee
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:170460:211"/>brake forth into tears, beſeeching him to give her ſome directions in ſpiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which accordingly hee did, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al referred her to a godly Neighbour, that might read them unto her, and ever after ſhee became eminent for piety, inſomuch, that ſhee and her Husband being very poor, in the evening ſhee would fetch an handful of thatch from her houſe, wanting candles, and kindling of it, ſhee would get her Husband to make haſte, and read as much out of the Bible as hee could whilſt the blaze laſted, which ſhee would mark diligently, and with a great deal of care and joy remember, and talk of it.</p>
                  <p>In the late bloody maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> divers Engliſh-women came to the houſe of Mr. <hi>Creighton,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Virginia,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> having a Maid in their company almoſt naked, unto whom an Iriſh Rebel came as ſhee was in the way, (theſe women being in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) requiring her to give him her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſwearing, that if ſhe did not, he would preſently kill her, and withal drew his Sword: The young woman anſwered, you cannot kill mee except God give you leave, and his will bee done: Hereupon,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:170460:211"/>the Rogue thruſt three times at her naked body with his drawn Sword, and yet could not pierce her skin. Upon this miracle he was much confounded, and ſo went away, and left her; this they atteſted upon oath.</p>
                  <p>A godly Gentlewoman, whom I very well know, yet living, when ſhee was a childe, being in the Country in the harveſt time, was playing by the ſide of a Pond, none being left at home but a man who was in the houſe reading a book, the Girl ſtepping upon a board that was looſe to play with the Ducks, fell into the Pond, where ſhee was like to periſh; but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, that the man, as hee was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was ſuddainly ſo troubled, though he knew not for what, that hee could read no longer; whereupon hee walked up and down the room, but could not bee quiet; then hee walked forth, and eſpied a Straw-Hat ſwimming upon the water, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtly, hee ſaw the childe riſe to the top of the water, and ſo catching hold of her, drew her out, and ſaved her life.</p>
                  <p>A Gentlewoman of a conſiderable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, that conſtantly at the years end gave all the over-plus of her Eſtate to the poor,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:170460:212"/>reſolving not to encreaſe her Eſtate, and there being a Famine, ſhee deſired leave of the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to plow up for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acres of land which ſhee was tyed by her Leaſe not to plow without leave, hee giving her leave, ſhee plowed it, and ſowed it for the poor with peaſe, when they were ripe, ſhee gave notice to the poor of the Country to come and gather them, which they did; and the Babyliff, when time was, carried in the Straw for Fodder, but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee might have ſome yeeld of peaſe, he thraſht ſome of the Straw for a Tryal, and had as much yeeld (notwithſtanding the poor had gathered them clean, as was thought) as uſually they had for a Crop. Thus God encreaſes their ſtore, that are liberal to thoſe that are in want.</p>
                  <p>I have heard it related of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> that as he was journeying, a poor man asked ſomething of him for Jeſus Chriſts ſake: Why, doeſt thou know Jeſus Chriſt? ſaid Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> and diſcourſing with him, hee found that hee ſpake ſavourly and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly of the things of God: I have no money, ſaid Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> but go with me to the Town which is cloſe by, and I ſhall give you ſomething; where ſelling his
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:170460:212"/>horſe, hee gave half the money to the poor man, and went the reſt of his way home on foot.</p>
                  <p>There was a very poor Widdow that had many children, and a rich Brother, that was a Batchelour, who lived as poor as ſhee, who very ſeldome would give her any thing, ſometimes ſome ſmall ſingle money; the laſt time ſhee came to him, though ſhee was in great want, and uſed much importunity, yet hee would not give her a farthing; ſhee then begg'd a cup of drink of him, hee pretends that he was ſo poor, that hee had not money to buy himſelf bread, and ſo ſent her away with nothing but her own tears to drink; but though weeping may endure for a night, joy comes in the morning, for the Lord ſtruck that hard-hearted man with death, and this poor woman being Heir to his Eſtate, was worth next day ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound, which with a great deal of care hee had ſcrap'd together, and with a great deal of uncharitableneſs had kept; and though hee would not give her a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over night, hee was forced to leave her all the next morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luther</hi> hath this ſtory: A certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:170460:213"/>in the time of famine, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all for her children and her ſelf to eat, being brought to very great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhee reſolv'd upon this courſe, ſhee made her ſelf, and all her children ready, and with a great deal of comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ſhee walked to a Spring, not far from her houſe, as ſhee was going, one met her, who ask'd her whether ſhee was going with her children? Shee told him, that all her proviſion was quite ſpent, and ſhee was going with her children to ſuch a Fountain cloſe by, being confident, that God that had provided drink for her and her children, would there provide food for them alſo; and hee that heard the young Ravens, and provided for them, would much more take care of her, and her little ones; hee that met her, wiſhed her to return home, for ſhee ſhould meet with proviſion that was ready for her there, ſhee returned, and found a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity of meal, which was food for her and her children; but whence this proviſion came, ſhee knew not, nor knew the man who told her of it.</p>
                  <p>There was a certain poor family, being in great wants, and had little or nothing
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:170460:213"/>for their children, when dinner came, they put them off with play-things, and told them they would ſee if they could get them ſomething for Supper; and when Supper came, they would give ſome ſmall piece of bread, and ſo get them to bed: And thus they uſed them ſo long, while at laſt the children would not to bed, but cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for bread; that night, it was ſo, that my Lord <hi>Fawkland</hi> waking before mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and could not ſleep, it came into his minde, that this family was in great want, inſomuch, that hee call'd up ſome of his ſervants and ſent them with a great loaf, and a Cheeſe to the houſe; when the ſervant came, hee found the children cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for bread, and the Parents weeping by them, who with a great deal of joy and eagerneſs, received that unexpected proviſion. Thus the Lord ordered it by his Providence, that they were not only then relieved, but their neceſſities being related to the Lord <hi>Fawkland</hi> by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, hee took care of them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Speed</hi> in his Chronicles relates this ſtory, there being a great famine the year before, as ſoon as the corn was ear'd, the poor
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:170460:214"/>would gather and eat, inſomuch, that the Inhabitants of the Pariſh came to the Prieſt, deſiring him to curſe the people for gathering and ſpoiling the corn, but one of the Pariſhioners ſtood up, and charged the Prieſt, that hee ſhould not curſe them for his corn, for it did him good, to ſee the poor eat his corn, for hee was very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their neceſſities, but the clamours of the others prevail'd; but as the Prieſt was curſing the poor, there fell a great ſtorm of Thunder, and Lightening, and Hail, which beat down all the corn ſo, as if Horſes and Carts had gone over it, nor would either beaſts, or any fowl, eat any thing of it, only this good mans corn, though intermingled with others, ſtood untouched, not an ear of it being blaſted.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Hill,</hi> in his book of living and dying well, hath a remarkable ſtory of a young Gentleman of one of the Innes of Court, who it ſeems expected to die ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and before hee ſhould bee twenty four years of age, and ſo hee did, having theſe verſes found about him, viz.</p>

                  <p>So grave a Doctor ſetting down this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his book, I thought it no lightneſs in mee, to ſet it down in mine.</p>
                  <p>The ſtory of Mr. <hi>Holland</hi> (not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very remarkable, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath pleaſed God to affect me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much with it) I ſhall ſetdown here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. This Mr. <hi>Holland</hi> was a pious and faithful Preacher of the Goſpel, as ſome that have been acquainted with him, and have heard him, have teſtified of him, a man that was a ſtranger and Pilgrime in the world, neither having any thing to do with it, nor indeed knew it, his Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging all his worldly affairs for him; hee knew not what the common coyns of gold were worth, and for his cloaths, except his Wife had otherwiſe ordered it, hee would have worn them till they had been rags; hee ſpent his time wholly in his Study, and a man of great charity, inſomuch, that if
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:170460:215"/>hee had no money about him, and a poor man had begg'd of him, hee would have given his Gloves, or Handkerchief, or Band, &amp;c. being regardleſs of all things, ſave the glory of God, and the Salvation of his own and others Souls: This preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saint, the day before his death, calling for a Bible, continued his Meditation and Expoſition, on the eighth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the ſpace of two hours; but on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, hee ſaid, O ſtay your reading, what brightneſs is this I ſee? and they ſaid, it is the Sun-ſhine; nay, ſaith hee, it is my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours ſhine: Now farewel world, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heaven, the Day-Star from on high hath viſited my heart, I doubt not but you all ſee that light, but I feel a light within me, that none of yee all can know; and then turning himſelf to the Miniſter, who preached his Funeral Sermon, who was one of them that came to viſit him, hee ſaid, Sir, I deſire you would preach my Funeral Sermon, for this night I dye, and ſpeak this from mee, and ſpeak it confidently, that God deales familiarly with man, (a rare and ſweet expreſſion) I feel his mercy, I ſee his Majeſty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the body, or out of the body, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:170460:215"/>tell, God hee knoweth; but I ſee things that are unutterable. And being thus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed in his ſpirit, hee roamed towards heaven, with a cheerful look, and ſoft ſweet voice, but what hee ſaid was not underſtood; raiſing himſelf towards morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did upon his ſtaff, hee ended his bleſſed life with theſe bleſſed words.</p>
                  <p>O what a happy change ſhall I make, from night to day, from darkneſs to light, from death to life, from ſorrow to ſolace, from a factious world to a heavenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Oh my dear brethren, ſiſters, and friends, it pittieth mee to leave you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, yet remember my death when I am gone, and what I now feel, I hope you ſhall feel, e're you die, that God doth, and will deal familiarly with man; and now thou fiery Chariot, that cameſt down to fetch up <hi>Elijah,</hi> carry mee to my happy hold; and all you bleſſed Angels, that attended the Soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> to bring it to heaven, bear mee, O bear mee into the boſome of my beſt beloved. <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi> Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly, and ſo hee fell aſleep.</p>
